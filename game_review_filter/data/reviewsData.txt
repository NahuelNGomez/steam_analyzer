1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",-1,1,1

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots.

Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.

Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",-1,1,91

A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house.

Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1,38

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.

When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",-1,1,122

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.

Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",-1,1,122

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1,38

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",-1,1,8

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1,38

The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots.

Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1,46

270880,American Truck Simulator,"  Having been born in New Mexico, United States, I tend to travel to Arizona, more importantly, flagstaff. I took a shippment from Kingsman AZ to Flagstaff AZ. and it took a while to get from point a to point b. anyways, I smiled when I read 'Albuquerque' when I got closer to flagstaff, my brain went into auto pilot mode when I got to a forested area and I thought 'Yeah, we're getting close to flagstaff.' then I had to pause the game and think about what I just thought about, No other game has ever made me think that.   My point is, this game has replicated some areas in real life pretty close to the real thing, that coupled with a few mods made me forget it was actually a game for a few seconds. Unbelieveable!",1,0,652

383870,Firewatch,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect going in, but from the first sarcastic remark, I was hooked. Though not without its share of flaws (run length, somewhat predictable plot, occasionally irksome backtracking), Firewatch draws you in with an intriguing mystery and some beautiful views, but its two main characters are really what sets it apart. They are both perfectly voice acted and brilliantly characterized.   Pros: Believable, thought out characters Excellent voice acting Witty dialogue Absorbing mystery The ending isn't overdone and fits well That sunset though  Cons: Underwhelming conclusion to the mystery Extremely linear Backtracking Short for the price  Firewatch is more like an interactive art piece than a typical game. Though games of this type are becoming more common, Firewatch really knocked it out of the park in my opinion. 8/10",1,0,696

383870,Firewatch,"Firewatch is a game that sold itself to me primarily on the amazing aesthetics, and I ended up going into it almost entirely blind. This turned out to be a furtunate decision, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it over a bit less than 4 hours, having had few expectations going in. And for the first time in a long time, I did another playthrough of a game very shortly after finishing it (clocking in another 3 hours), in order to see what I had missed the first time around.  Briefly, Firewatch is a narrative game centering around two people, one of whom is the protagonist, Henry, who has taken the job to monitor for the presence of fires in the Shoshone National Forest, from atop a guard tower. The main gameplay element, and the major draw, is the radio that Henry carries during his duties, which connects him with the second major character, his supervisor Delilah. Delilah not only gives Henry tasks to complete, typically involving longer or short trips into the wilderness, but also grows to be a close and familiar presence to both Henry and the player, and their interactions form the backbone of the game. During their interactions, the player has the option of choosing between various responses, or even no response, shaping the narrative between the two. I found this aspect of the game to be incredibly well done, thanks to a great script and the fantastic voice acting performed for both characters. The game is further underlined by an incredible soundtrack, which I found to fit the story and the setting very well, and which makes for great listening on its own.  However, as the narrative is the backbone of the game, more gamey elements take a backseat. There are very minor puzzle elements, and some minor 'collectibles' which allow you to learn about some secondary characters, but these take the back-seat to the narrative between Henry and Delilah. Fortunately, I would argue, as the game would not have been any better in my eyes had it included an abundance of such elements. If I have to make one criticism, it would be that the game could have benefitted from a bit more time spent fleshing out the relationship between Delilah and Henry, before the plot gains steam.  Finally, while some were apparently disappointed by the ending, I will say that I am not among those. In fact, now that I know the full scope of the story, I was eager to play the game again, to reshape the narrative (in some ways) compared to my last play-through, and to see what hints, clues, and   turtles   I missed the first time around. Indeed, playing the game again provided answers to several questions that I had missed during my first playthrough, and revealed additional background information thanks to different dialogue choices, though I did find that this also revealed that certain parts of the conversation were not as flexible as I had hoped. Still, for me, both the game and the soundtrack was worth every cent, and worth playing through twice.   A final recommendation before I finish: By default the game will show your exact location on the map, and pop up notifications when your objective changes. It is, however, possible to turn both of these features off, and I would strongly urge anyone playing Firewatch to do so, as this makes for a much more immersive experience. Furthermore, I would also recommend playing with head-phones, to enhance the already great sound-design, both in terms of the environmental audio and the music.",1,0,280

270880,American Truck Simulator,"  Having been born in New Mexico, United States, I tend to travel to Arizona, more importantly, flagstaff. I took a shippment from Kingsman AZ to Flagstaff AZ. and it took a while to get from point a to point b. anyways, I smiled when I read 'Albuquerque' when I got closer to flagstaff, my brain went into auto pilot mode when I got to a forested area and I thought 'Yeah, we're getting close to flagstaff.' then I had to pause the game and think about what I just thought about, No other game has ever made me think that.   My point is, this game has replicated some areas in real life pretty close to the real thing, that coupled with a few mods made me forget it was actually a game for a few seconds.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has played ETS (The $19.99AUD pricetag is more than justifiable), or those that are on the fence about whether to purchase a truck simulator or not.   Should you be a newbie, and faced with the choice between ETS 2 and ATS, I'd strongly recommend going with ETS 2.   New additions such as police cars that become portable speed cameras and roads that become flooded with tumbleweeds give a fresh feel, but it's still just ETS 2 (not that that's necessarily a bad thing).   7.5/10  tl:dr - It's a good game, but glorified DLC for ETS 2.",1,0,1726

And that's really the only qualm I had (among other vastly smaller nitpicks), will you be able to get the marble to it's ultimate destination?

Though not without its share of flaws (run length, somewhat predictable plot, occasionally irksome backtracking), Firewatch draws you in with an intriguing mystery and some beautiful views, but its two main characters are really what sets it apart. They are both perfectly voice acted and brilliantly characterized.   Pros: Believable, thought out characters Excellent voice acting Witty dialogue Absorbing mystery The ending isn't overdone and fits well That sunset though  Cons: Underwhelming conclusion to the mystery Extremely linear Backtracking Short for the price  Firewatch is more like an interactive art piece than a typical game.

383870,Firewatch,"Firewatch is a game that sold itself to me primarily on the amazing aesthetics, and I ended up going into it almost entirely blind. This turned out to be a furtunate decision, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it over a bit less than 4 hours, having had few expectations going in. And for the first time in a long time, I did another playthrough of a game very shortly after finishing it (clocking in another 3 hours), in order to see what I had missed the first time around.  Briefly, Firewatch is a narrative game centering around two people, one of whom is the protagonist, Henry, who has taken the job to monitor for the presence of fires in the Shoshone National Forest, from atop a guard tower. The main gameplay element, and the major draw, is the radio that Henry carries during his duties, which connects him with the second major character, his supervisor Delilah. Delilah not only gives Henry tasks to complete, typically involving longer or short trips into the wilderness, but also grows to be a close and familiar presence to both Henry and the player, and their interactions form the backbone of the game. During their interactions, the player has the option of choosing between various responses, or even no response, shaping the narrative between the two. I found this aspect of the game to be incredibly well done, thanks to a great script and the fantastic voice acting performed for both characters. The game is further underlined by an incredible soundtrack, which I found to fit the story and the setting very well, and which makes for great listening on its own.  However, as the narrative is the backbone of the game, more gamey elements take a backseat. There are very minor puzzle elements, and some minor 'collectibles' which allow you to learn about some secondary characters, but these take the back-seat to the narrative between Henry and Delilah. Fortunately, I would argue, as the game would not have been any better in my eyes had it included an abundance of such elements. If I have to make one criticism, it would be that the game could have benefitted from a bit more time spent fleshing out the relationship between Delilah and Henry, before the plot gains steam.  Finally, while some were apparently disappointed by the ending, I will say that I am not among those. In fact, now that I know the full scope of the story, I was eager to play the game again, to reshape the narrative (in some ways) compared to my last play-through, and to see what hints, clues, and   turtles   I missed the first time around. Indeed, playing the game again provided answers to several questions that I had missed during my first playthrough, and revealed additional background information thanks to different dialogue choices, though I did find that this also revealed that certain parts of the conversation were not as flexible as I had hoped. Still, for me, both the game and the soundtrack was worth every cent, and worth playing through twice.   A final recommendation before I finish: By default the game will show your exact location on the map, and pop up notifications when your objective changes. It is, however, possible to turn both of these features off, and I would strongly urge anyone playing Firewatch to do so, as this makes for a much more immersive experience. Furthermore, I would also recommend playing with head-phones, to enhance the already great sound-design, both in terms of the environmental audio and the music.",1,0,280

270880,American Truck Simulator,"American Truck Simulator feels more like a downloadable add-on for Euro Truck Simulator 2 than it does a standalone game.  While the locale and trucks are different, the aesthetic and UI remain exactly the same.   Nonetheless, I am thoroughly enjoying ATS, cruising through Nevada, getting my deliveries done. I highly recommend this to anyone who has played ETS (The $19.99AUD pricetag is more than justifiable), or those that are on the fence about whether to purchase a truck simulator or not.   Should you be a newbie, and faced with the choice between ETS 2 and ATS, I'd strongly recommend going with ETS 2.   New additions such as police cars that become portable speed cameras and roads that become flooded with tumbleweeds give a fresh feel, but it's still just ETS 2 (not that that's necessarily a bad thing).   7.5/10  tl:dr - It's a good game, but glorified DLC for ETS 2.",1,0,1726

409390,Marble Mountain,"Marble Mountain is an enjoyable game where a little marble goes on a big adventure. Very much like a spiritual successor to Marble Madness, Marble Mountain focuses on controlling a marble and having it zip through tricky but enjoyable obstacles.

And that's really the only qualm I had (among other vastly smaller nitpicks), will you be able to get the marble to it's ultimate destination?  With plenty of levels, appealing visuals, monumental design, and tons of customization for the marble Marble Mountain is a game worth picking up.",1,0,2107

383870,Firewatch,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect going in, but from the first sarcastic remark, I was hooked. Though not without its share of flaws (run length, somewhat predictable plot, occasionally irksome backtracking), Firewatch draws you in with an intriguing mystery and some beautiful views, but its two main characters are really what sets it apart. They are both perfectly voice acted and brilliantly characterized.   Pros: Believable, thought out characters Excellent voice acting Witty dialogue Absorbing mystery The ending isn't overdone and fits well That sunset though  Cons: Underwhelming conclusion to the mystery Extremely linear Backtracking Short for the price  Firewatch is more like an interactive art piece than a typical game. Though games of this type are becoming more common, Firewatch really knocked it out of the park in my opinion. 8/10",1,0,696

Here is my review after first 30 minutes of play.  Graphics: 8 - Cartoony but perfectly fitting this sort of goofy/cartoony game.  Sound: 7 - Soudtrack is pretty decent so far, the voice acting is quirky but well done. The sound effects could use a bit more variation but it hasn't yet ruined the expeirence.  Controls: 9 - Responsive, So far I only used the wired Xbox360 controller, not the mouse and keyboard or two player (a person on each)  Fun Factor: 8 - So far the game is fun, has a nice storyline and doesn't take itself all too seriously. The feel matches the graphics and sound so I would recommend playing it.  I will return to review after I finish the game for a full review.   Enjoy",1,0,931

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting. Good Game, really.  I haven't tried GC3 as of yet, but I hope they've made some good improvements, and didn't wreck anything.  -Cheers  PS: Watching multiple variants of Veritech fighters escorting an ID4 City-Destroyer face off against Stargate Daedalus-Class ships escorting X-COM Battleships?

35700,Trine,"This is your Classic side scroller. You fight baddies, solve simple/moderatly difficult puzzles, and defeat occational bosses. For the most part its all about timing and not running out of health or energy. The puzzles are easy, and the fights arent hard, but add in a bit of fumbling to jump/move properly or position a block quickly/precisely and you run into annoyingly road-blocks/set-backs. Its not that its hard it just takes a couple more tries than would be entertaining.   I recommend and do not recommend this title. Its really 50/50",1,0,12175

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679
233450,Prison Architect,"Fantastic game! very addicting. The game mechanics are well done, the gameplay is fun and entertaining. You can build your own prison from nothing to a massive 500 cell mega facility. You can do everything from scheduling classes to death row appeals. Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background. The game is also completely missing any sort of main menu when you first launch the game. I highly recommend this game and I rate it 4 out of 5.",1,0,13068

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative. Prison Architect is extremely addicting for me, it's challenging and it is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.",1,0,19156

Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.

You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

271820,Card City Nights," Card City Nights is a true gem among the numerous games many indie studios release.   Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.  The deck building interface leaves some things to be desired, but is completely usable.   Card City Nights offers a fun challenge for both serious and casual gamers.  10/10",1,0,28028

268750,Magicite,"Firstly , Magicite is an amazing game with 9/10 graphics. But its very hard which adds challenge so it wont be like ' Hey , TAKE THIS WITH YOU ' or something like that. There are alot of gamers who dont like hard games. I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now. Or there could be a trade feature where players can trade OP , Non-OP weapons and armors through trade , and the comunity market.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

233450,Prison Architect,"I adore this game, you should aswell, best prison simulator around. And far worth the price. I backed it on early access and watched it grow into the fine game it is today. The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,Awesome game. Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve because it lacks a proper ingame guide. There is a tutorial that explains the basic and together with some tips &amp; guides from the internet you will work it. Its very similar to the Civ series but in space and with some nice feature like a ship designer where you can customize the look and loadout of your own ships. So if you like turnbased civ building games this is a must have.,1,0,46057

252010,Oniken,Awesome old school game. If you grew up playing games on the original NES you should really appreciate this. It's hard but it's also very well made.,1,0,46642
251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a great sandbox game that gives a lot of room and possibilities for one's own creativity and to go full nerd-mod. Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play. There is a great development team behind the game and an even greater community that amazes again and again with their own creations and helping side. Even not being totally finished (last update planned for august 2016) it was all the way and will always be an enjoyable game.",1,0,46985

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

268750,Magicite,"This game is completely amazing. There's a long list of districts/levels and I can't notice that many bugs in the game :D! But there are two things I'd liked to say about it:  -There's a bug when you glide down with the hive goggles, not bad, but a bit annoying, it sort of glitches around.  -Can the developers please add a save game proccess?? That would help out a TONNE.  Overall, I love the game, thanks for making it &lt;3 :D",1,0,9500
270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

35700,Trine,"TRINE IS NOT MADE FOR SINGLE PLAYER  Pros: -Fun and interestic platforming with plenty of unique puzzles -Great soundtrack -3 Player Co-Op -Looks nice -Decent story -Clever level design  Cons: -Very short -Trine was made for multiplayer. Single player is incredibly easy and allows you to skip over a majority of the puzzles with ease. -Knight felt useless to me -I personally thought the voice acting sucked  Overall: If you have 2 other friends who have this game, buy it, it will be worth your money. Otherwise, leave it alone, single player is short and easy. It was pretty disappointing to me.  Trine is certainly not a bad game, in fact, it's an excellent game. But it was made for multiplayer.

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting. Good Game, really.  I haven't tried GC3 as of yet, but I hope they've made some good improvements, and didn't wreck anything.  -Cheers  PS: Watching multiple variants of Veritech fighters escorting an ID4 City-Destroyer face off against Stargate Daedalus-Class ships escorting X-COM Battleships?

35700,Trine,"This is your Classic side scroller. You fight baddies, solve simple/moderatly difficult puzzles, and defeat occational bosses. For the most part its all about timing and not running out of health or energy. The puzzles are easy, and the fights arent hard, but add in a bit of fumbling to jump/move properly or position a block quickly/precisely and you run into annoyingly road-blocks/set-backs. Its not that its hard it just takes a couple more tries than would be entertaining.   I recommend and do not recommend this title. Its really 50/50",1,0,12175

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679
233450,Prison Architect,"Fantastic game! very addicting. The game mechanics are well done, the gameplay is fun and entertaining. You can build your own prison from nothing to a massive 500 cell mega facility. You can do everything from scheduling classes to death row appeals. Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background. The game is also completely missing any sort of main menu when you first launch the game. I highly recommend this game and I rate it 4 out of 5.",1,0,13068

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative.

Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.

Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.  Cons : -Can't really think of anything, maybe some little bugs.",1,0,21417

271820,Card City Nights," Card City Nights is a true gem among the numerous games many indie studios release.   Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.  The deck building interface leaves some things to be desired, but is completely usable.   Card City Nights offers a fun challenge for both serious and casual gamers.  10/10",1,0,28028

There are alot of gamers who dont like hard games. I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147

This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

Nevertheless it's also a ton of fun and it will encourage you to find the best solution to deal with each monster, due to the possibilities of customization and the equipment at your disposal, which is quite remarkable.

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

233450,Prison Architect,"Perhaps a little on the easy side. There's a compelling theme of controlling the lives, environment and regime of inmates. Control freaks will love this game.  Even though the premise is seedy in that you pamper (or not) or otherwise 'care' for your 'villagers' who are all criminals of varying degrees of severity, you can lose hours building and planning out new wings and sections.  Don't know when it was added, but the traits (deadly, stoic etc..) really add something to the game.  Touch of theme park, the sims and some Dwarf Fortress lite.  A great  Early Access  game that I recommend.",1,1,4108

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

35700,Trine,"TRINE IS NOT MADE FOR SINGLE PLAYER  Pros: -Fun and interestic platforming with plenty of unique puzzles -Great soundtrack -3 Player Co-Op -Looks nice -Decent story -Clever level design  Cons: -Very short -Trine was made for multiplayer. Single player is incredibly easy and allows you to skip over a majority of the puzzles with ease. -Knight felt useless to me -I personally thought the voice acting sucked  Overall: If you have 2 other friends who have this game, buy it, it will be worth your money. Otherwise, leave it alone, single player is short and easy. It was pretty disappointing to me.  Trine is certainly not a bad game, in fact, it's an excellent game. But it was made for multiplayer.

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting. Good Game, really.  I haven't tried GC3 as of yet, but I hope they've made some good improvements, and didn't wreck anything.  -Cheers  PS: Watching multiple variants of Veritech fighters escorting an ID4 City-Destroyer face off against Stargate Daedalus-Class ships escorting X-COM Battleships?

35700,Trine,"This is your Classic side scroller. You fight baddies, solve simple/moderatly difficult puzzles, and defeat occational bosses. For the most part its all about timing and not running out of health or energy. The puzzles are easy, and the fights arent hard, but add in a bit of fumbling to jump/move properly or position a block quickly/precisely and you run into annoyingly road-blocks/set-backs. Its not that its hard it just takes a couple more tries than would be entertaining.   I recommend and do not recommend this title. Its really 50/50",1,0,12175

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679
233450,Prison Architect,"Fantastic game! very addicting. The game mechanics are well done, the gameplay is fun and entertaining. You can build your own prison from nothing to a massive 500 cell mega facility. You can do everything from scheduling classes to death row appeals. Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background. The game is also completely missing any sort of main menu when you first launch the game. I highly recommend this game and I rate it 4 out of 5.",1,0,13068

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative. Prison Architect is extremely addicting for me, it's challenging and it is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.",1,0,19156

233450,Prison Architect,"This game is amazingly addicting and way to much controlling every minute of prisoners lives. It should not be this fun. Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

233450,Prison Architect,"Really good management game. You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.  Cons : -Can't really think of anything, maybe some little bugs.",1,0,21417

Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147

This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

233450,Prison Architect,"Perhaps a little on the easy side. There's a compelling theme of controlling the lives, environment and regime of inmates. Control freaks will love this game.  Even though the premise is seedy in that you pamper (or not) or otherwise 'care' for your 'villagers' who are all criminals of varying degrees of severity, you can lose hours building and planning out new wings and sections.  Don't know when it was added, but the traits (deadly, stoic etc..) really add something to the game.  Touch of theme park, the sims and some Dwarf Fortress lite.

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

35700,Trine,"TRINE IS NOT MADE FOR SINGLE PLAYER  Pros: -Fun and interestic platforming with plenty of unique puzzles -Great soundtrack -3 Player Co-Op -Looks nice -Decent story -Clever level design  Cons: -Very short -Trine was made for multiplayer. Single player is incredibly easy and allows you to skip over a majority of the puzzles with ease. -Knight felt useless to me -I personally thought the voice acting sucked  Overall: If you have 2 other friends who have this game, buy it, it will be worth your money. Otherwise, leave it alone, single player is short and easy. It was pretty disappointing to me.  Trine is certainly not a bad game, in fact, it's an excellent game. But it was made for multiplayer.

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting. Good Game, really.  I haven't tried GC3 as of yet, but I hope they've made some good improvements, and didn't wreck anything.  -Cheers  PS: Watching multiple variants of Veritech fighters escorting an ID4 City-Destroyer face off against Stargate Daedalus-Class ships escorting X-COM Battleships?

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679

Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background.

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative. Prison Architect is extremely addicting for me, it's challenging and it is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.",1,0,19156

233450,Prison Architect,"This game is amazingly addicting and way to much controlling every minute of prisoners lives. It should not be this fun. Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

233450,Prison Architect,"Really good management game. You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.

233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

Either way, there is fun to be had in this epic world.",1,0,45823
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,Awesome game. Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve because it lacks a proper ingame guide. There is a tutorial that explains the basic and together with some tips &amp; guides from the internet you will work it. Its very similar to the Civ series but in space and with some nice feature like a ship designer where you can customize the look and loadout of your own ships. So if you like turnbased civ building games this is a must have.,1,0,46057

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a great sandbox game that gives a lot of room and possibilities for one's own creativity and to go full nerd-mod. Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play. There is a great development team behind the game and an even greater community that amazes again and again with their own creations and helping side. Even not being totally finished (last update planned for august 2016) it was all the way and will always be an enjoyable game.",1,0,46985

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.

202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting. Good Game, really.  I haven't tried GC3 as of yet, but I hope they've made some good improvements, and didn't wreck anything.  -Cheers  PS: Watching multiple variants of Veritech fighters escorting an ID4 City-Destroyer face off against Stargate Daedalus-Class ships escorting X-COM Battleships?

The puzzles are easy, and the fights arent hard, but add in a bit of fumbling to jump/move properly or position a block quickly/precisely and you run into annoyingly road-blocks/set-backs. Its not that its hard it just takes a couple more tries than would be entertaining.   I recommend and do not recommend this title. Its really 50/50",1,0,12175

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679
233450,Prison Architect,"Fantastic game! very addicting. The game mechanics are well done, the gameplay is fun and entertaining. You can build your own prison from nothing to a massive 500 cell mega facility. You can do everything from scheduling classes to death row appeals. Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background. The game is also completely missing any sort of main menu when you first launch the game. I highly recommend this game and I rate it 4 out of 5.",1,0,13068

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative. Prison Architect is extremely addicting for me, it's challenging and it is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.",1,0,19156

233450,Prison Architect,"This game is amazingly addicting and way to much controlling every minute of prisoners lives. It should not be this fun. Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

Many puzzles to solve -the wizard is your best friend :)  + Beautiful graphics + Nice sound effects and background music + Great gameplay  - Controls kinda hard in the begining - Too short ,1,0,31408

233450,Prison Architect,"Had this game from the begining and let me just say it has become THE benchmark when it comes to this type of game. Nobody does it better, nobody may ever do it better! So buy the god damn thing right now!!",1,0,31544
233450,Prison Architect,I just love this game. Its really good and Its not bad.  Everything in my prison is going great. I love every part of it.      Except for those 4 prisoners that tunneled their way out.,1,0,32089
268750,Magicite,"Firstly , Magicite is an amazing game with 9/10 graphics. But its very hard which adds challenge so it wont be like ' Hey , TAKE THIS WITH YOU ' or something like that. There are alot of gamers who dont like hard games. I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now. Or there could be a trade feature where players can trade OP , Non-OP weapons and armors through trade , and the comunity market. Overall the game is great with lots of challenge and fun many gamers thrive on.",1,0,32198

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575
233450,Prison Architect,Heartly recommend!!! Great simulation game with sufficient playability.,1,1,33593
233450,Prison Architect,"I adore this game, you should aswell, best prison simulator around. And far worth the price. I backed it on early access and watched it grow into the fine game it is today. The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,Awesome game. Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve because it lacks a proper ingame guide. There is a tutorial that explains the basic and together with some tips &amp; guides from the internet you will work it. Its very similar to the Civ series but in space and with some nice feature like a ship designer where you can customize the look and loadout of your own ships.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play.

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting. Good Game, really.

35700,Trine,"This is your Classic side scroller. You fight baddies, solve simple/moderatly difficult puzzles, and defeat occational bosses. For the most part its all about timing and not running out of health or energy. The puzzles are easy, and the fights arent hard, but add in a bit of fumbling to jump/move properly or position a block quickly/precisely and you run into annoyingly road-blocks/set-backs. Its not that its hard it just takes a couple more tries than would be entertaining.   I recommend and do not recommend this title. Its really 50/50",1,0,12175

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679
233450,Prison Architect,"Fantastic game! very addicting. The game mechanics are well done, the gameplay is fun and entertaining. You can build your own prison from nothing to a massive 500 cell mega facility. You can do everything from scheduling classes to death row appeals. Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background. The game is also completely missing any sort of main menu when you first launch the game. I highly recommend this game and I rate it 4 out of 5.",1,0,13068

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative.

Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.

Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

271820,Card City Nights," Card City Nights is a true gem among the numerous games many indie studios release.   Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.  The deck building interface leaves some things to be desired, but is completely usable.   Card City Nights offers a fun challenge for both serious and casual gamers.  10/10",1,0,28028

There are alot of gamers who dont like hard games. I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now. Or there could be a trade feature where players can trade OP , Non-OP weapons and armors through trade , and the comunity market.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

233450,Prison Architect,"I adore this game, you should aswell, best prison simulator around. And far worth the price. I backed it on early access and watched it grow into the fine game it is today. The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing.

This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect, Early Access Review,1,0,44437
233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,Awesome game. Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve because it lacks a proper ingame guide. There is a tutorial that explains the basic and together with some tips &amp; guides from the internet you will work it. Its very similar to the Civ series but in space and with some nice feature like a ship designer where you can customize the look and loadout of your own ships.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a great sandbox game that gives a lot of room and possibilities for one's own creativity and to go full nerd-mod. Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play. There is a great development team behind the game and an even greater community that amazes again and again with their own creations and helping side.

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

I wasn't really thinking I would get into this game but 6 hours after starting, I'm still going and can't wait to play the sequel. I definitely recommend this game especially with the holiday sale!",1,0,8390

268750,Magicite,"This game is completely amazing. There's a long list of districts/levels and I can't notice that many bugs in the game :D! But there are two things I'd liked to say about it:  -There's a bug when you glide down with the hive goggles, not bad, but a bit annoying, it sort of glitches around.  -Can the developers please add a save game proccess?? That would help out a TONNE.  Overall, I love the game, thanks for making it &lt;3 :D",1,0,9500
270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

35700,Trine,"TRINE IS NOT MADE FOR SINGLE PLAYER  Pros: -Fun and interestic platforming with plenty of unique puzzles -Great soundtrack -3 Player Co-Op -Looks nice -Decent story -Clever level design  Cons: -Very short -Trine was made for multiplayer. Single player is incredibly easy and allows you to skip over a majority of the puzzles with ease. -Knight felt useless to me -I personally thought the voice acting sucked  Overall: If you have 2 other friends who have this game, buy it, it will be worth your money. Otherwise, leave it alone, single player is short and easy. It was pretty disappointing to me.  Trine is certainly not a bad game, in fact, it's an excellent game. But it was made for multiplayer.

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting. Good Game, really.  I haven't tried GC3 as of yet, but I hope they've made some good improvements, and didn't wreck anything.  -Cheers  PS: Watching multiple variants of Veritech fighters escorting an ID4 City-Destroyer face off against Stargate Daedalus-Class ships escorting X-COM Battleships?

35700,Trine,"This is your Classic side scroller. You fight baddies, solve simple/moderatly difficult puzzles, and defeat occational bosses. For the most part its all about timing and not running out of health or energy. The puzzles are easy, and the fights arent hard, but add in a bit of fumbling to jump/move properly or position a block quickly/precisely and you run into annoyingly road-blocks/set-backs. Its not that its hard it just takes a couple more tries than would be entertaining.   I recommend and do not recommend this title. Its really 50/50",1,0,12175

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679
233450,Prison Architect,"Fantastic game! very addicting. The game mechanics are well done, the gameplay is fun and entertaining. You can build your own prison from nothing to a massive 500 cell mega facility. You can do everything from scheduling classes to death row appeals. Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background. The game is also completely missing any sort of main menu when you first launch the game. I highly recommend this game and I rate it 4 out of 5.",1,0,13068

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative.

Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"This game is fantastic.  It is a trippy FPS style game where you play a robot on a single wheel (so the movement is purposefully floaty) and you play dodgeball in a crazy discotech with awesome music and cool light effects.   There is few community, mainly because I don't think people really remember to play this game, not because its boring or bad. I have a blast whenever I play, or until I ragequit from arcade mode. =P  Anyways, pick it up on a sale to give it a try, or better yet, grab a four pack so we can get some more people in there to play this fun game!",1,1,24187

233450,Prison Architect,Great Game where you create the content so it is endless. I have put over 100 hours in this game and would definitely recommend BUT if you plan to make very big prisons make sure to have a pretty fast computer because once you get about 1000 people moving in your prison your game starts to lag so that is something to keep in mind.,1,0,24812

271820,Card City Nights," Card City Nights is a true gem among the numerous games many indie studios release.   Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.  The deck building interface leaves some things to be desired, but is completely usable.   Card City Nights offers a fun challenge for both serious and casual gamers.  10/10",1,0,28028

268750,Magicite,"Firstly , Magicite is an amazing game with 9/10 graphics. But its very hard which adds challenge so it wont be like ' Hey , TAKE THIS WITH YOU ' or something like that. There are alot of gamers who dont like hard games. I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now. Or there could be a trade feature where players can trade OP , Non-OP weapons and armors through trade , and the comunity market.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

233450,Prison Architect,"I adore this game, you should aswell, best prison simulator around. And far worth the price. I backed it on early access and watched it grow into the fine game it is today. The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

They will become your nightmare) and some puzzles are difficult to solve and a bit frustrating at times. Nevertheless it's also a ton of fun and it will encourage you to find the best solution to deal with each monster, due to the possibilities of customization and the equipment at your disposal, which is quite remarkable.  Legend of Grimrock 2 is probably not a game for everyone, but if you are looking for something challenging then give it a shot.",1,0,40903

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play.

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

233450,Prison Architect,"Perhaps a little on the easy side. There's a compelling theme of controlling the lives, environment and regime of inmates. Control freaks will love this game.  Even though the premise is seedy in that you pamper (or not) or otherwise 'care' for your 'villagers' who are all criminals of varying degrees of severity, you can lose hours building and planning out new wings and sections.  Don't know when it was added, but the traits (deadly, stoic etc..) really add something to the game.  Touch of theme park, the sims and some Dwarf Fortress lite.  A great  Early Access  game that I recommend.",1,1,4108

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

35700,Trine,"TRINE IS NOT MADE FOR SINGLE PLAYER  Pros: -Fun and interestic platforming with plenty of unique puzzles -Great soundtrack -3 Player Co-Op -Looks nice -Decent story -Clever level design  Cons: -Very short -Trine was made for multiplayer. Single player is incredibly easy and allows you to skip over a majority of the puzzles with ease. -Knight felt useless to me -I personally thought the voice acting sucked  Overall: If you have 2 other friends who have this game, buy it, it will be worth your money. Otherwise, leave it alone, single player is short and easy. It was pretty disappointing to me.  Trine is certainly not a bad game, in fact, it's an excellent game. But it was made for multiplayer.

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting. Good Game, really.  I haven't tried GC3 as of yet, but I hope they've made some good improvements, and didn't wreck anything.  -Cheers  PS: Watching multiple variants of Veritech fighters escorting an ID4 City-Destroyer face off against Stargate Daedalus-Class ships escorting X-COM Battleships?

35700,Trine,"This is your Classic side scroller. You fight baddies, solve simple/moderatly difficult puzzles, and defeat occational bosses. For the most part its all about timing and not running out of health or energy. The puzzles are easy, and the fights arent hard, but add in a bit of fumbling to jump/move properly or position a block quickly/precisely and you run into annoyingly road-blocks/set-backs. Its not that its hard it just takes a couple more tries than would be entertaining.   I recommend and do not recommend this title. Its really 50/50",1,0,12175

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679
233450,Prison Architect,"Fantastic game! very addicting. The game mechanics are well done, the gameplay is fun and entertaining. You can build your own prison from nothing to a massive 500 cell mega facility. You can do everything from scheduling classes to death row appeals. Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background. The game is also completely missing any sort of main menu when you first launch the game. I highly recommend this game and I rate it 4 out of 5.",1,0,13068

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative. Prison Architect is extremely addicting for me, it's challenging and it is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.",1,0,19156

233450,Prison Architect,"This game is amazingly addicting and way to much controlling every minute of prisoners lives. It should not be this fun. Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

233450,Prison Architect,"Really good management game. You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.  Cons : -Can't really think of anything, maybe some little bugs.",1,0,21417

Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147

Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

Even though the premise is seedy in that you pamper (or not) or otherwise 'care' for your 'villagers' who are all criminals of varying degrees of severity, you can lose hours building and planning out new wings and sections.  Don't know when it was added, but the traits (deadly, stoic etc..) really add something to the game.  Touch of theme park, the sims and some Dwarf Fortress lite.

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

Single player is incredibly easy and allows you to skip over a majority of the puzzles with ease. -Knight felt useless to me -I personally thought the voice acting sucked  Overall: If you have 2 other friends who have this game, buy it, it will be worth your money. Otherwise, leave it alone, single player is short and easy. It was pretty disappointing to me.  Trine is certainly not a bad game, in fact, it's an excellent game. But it was made for multiplayer.

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting. Good Game, really.  I haven't tried GC3 as of yet, but I hope they've made some good improvements, and didn't wreck anything.  -Cheers  PS: Watching multiple variants of Veritech fighters escorting an ID4 City-Destroyer face off against Stargate Daedalus-Class ships escorting X-COM Battleships?

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679

Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background.

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative. Prison Architect is extremely addicting for me, it's challenging and it is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.",1,0,19156

233450,Prison Architect,"This game is amazingly addicting and way to much controlling every minute of prisoners lives. It should not be this fun. Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

233450,Prison Architect,"Really good management game. You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,Awesome game. Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve because it lacks a proper ingame guide. There is a tutorial that explains the basic and together with some tips &amp; guides from the internet you will work it. Its very similar to the Civ series but in space and with some nice feature like a ship designer where you can customize the look and loadout of your own ships.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play. There is a great development team behind the game and an even greater community that amazes again and again with their own creations and helping side.

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

213330,LEGO® Batman™ 2: DC Super Heroes,"LEGO Batman 2 is the first LEGO game that I’ve actually finished. Well, I may be slightly abusing the term “finished” here. My playthrough ended recently at 22.3%. So “abandoned” might be a more apt characterization, although in fairness to me, I did complete the story mode. I started playing the first game in this series and abandoned it fairly early on, probably due to the fact that the keyboard-and-mouse controls are abominable. Setting up a controller to play and actually playing with a controller are a breeze but do not–under any circumstances–attempt to play this game without one.  All of the LEGO games are built on a similar foundation: smashing enemies and collecting bricks/studs with which to purchase unlocks/abilities. There is some platforming involved but puzzles are essentially limited to figuring out which superpower/suit is needed to remove an obstacle to progress. As such the gameplay is amusing in short bursts but tiresome over the long haul, especially if you’re 1) over the age of 10; and 2) playing by yourself.  The story is a slight but entertaining tale that begins with The Joker and various other Bat-villains robbing the guests at Gotham’s Man of the Year awards ceremony and segues into Lex Luthor recruiting The Joker to aid him in his bid to win the presidency of the United States. Batman and Robin eventually have to call Superman to help out, and eventually, with the Last Son of Krypton greatly weakened by exposure to Kryptonite, the JLA shows up to aid in the capture of the evil duo. (Interestingly, Superman is almost too powerful in this game, as he’s essentially invulnerable to harm and has abilities that the Dynamic Duo need four different suits to replicate.) The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and once you get past the major conceit that all of these characters are essentially self-aware toys, it’s pretty funny.  Once you’ve completed the story in LEGO Batman 2, you can take any currently-unlocked character and faff about in Gotham City, looking for imperiled citizens to rescue or miscreants to defeat. Although the game drops frequent hints about nearly every other aspect of gameplay, the method of actually unlocking characters remains somewhat obscure. Occasionally during a fight (for characters) or while wandering the cityscape and passing near an object (for vehicles), you will receive a button prompt and a message advising you that you can purchase that item for x number of studs. Once you do, that item is added to your roster/garage. In the course of your travels, you will discover items that can only be interacted with using the abilities of specific characters such as Poison Ivy, Man-Bat, or The Joker. However, actually obtaining those characters appears to be a surprisingly trial-and-error affair. Upon completion of the story, I had Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and a few assorted goons unlocked for a grand total of 12 out of 60 unlockable characters. (You can also replay any section of the story in “Free Play” mode (meaning with access to any unlocked character), but of course this approach suffers from the same shortcomings I mentioned above.)  The game looks and sounds great, but we come back to the fundamental problem of gameplay and the nature of LEGO games. These are games that are meant for kids and co-op. They are meant to be played several times, uncovering more bits and bobs on each playthrough. These are all concepts that are antithetical to the way that I play games. I don’t have kids or a gamer spouse and I rarely play through a game more than once. Kids don’t really mind repetition and doing the same thing ad nauseum; in fact, I’d venture to say psychologists probably have some term for a childhood phase during which they absolutely thrive on it. As an adult, I don’t normally bother with replays simply because if a game offers nothing new on a replay other than a different character, it doesn’t have enough novel content to justify spending my time.",-1,0,388

268750,Magicite,"Starting with positive, I like the controls they feel tight and responsive so far, I like the artstyle, and in general I actually really like the concept of this, Feels more like an arcade version of terreria.  BUT almost instantly, out of principle I have to give it a no just because the crafting is so annoying.  I didn't realize it would be so unintuitive. clunkily halving ingrediants then crafting 15 sword hilts or whatever because I don't know how to grab just 1 at a time and couldn't even if I wanted to because the inventory is stupidly small.  another game with unnecessary amounts of time researching recipes online as I play. Sure after a week or so I will probably get most of it down but the thing is It adds NOTHING to the game, it only takes away from it.  For a game that feels much like an arcadey platformer pop-in-for-a-half-hour-session type of game, I really don't understand what they were thinking with the crafting.   The game is at it's core a a relatively simple action/rpg arcade platformer style level based game. design the game as such IMO, it seems to have some identity issues going on.  add up resources like you do the gold, Have some sort of crafting menu that simply shows you what you can craft and what you need.  Simply click if you have the ingrediants.  wow was that so hard? probably would have saved me 3-4 hours of wiki'ing. and if someone were to argue 'well that's the fun, you need to be smart about your space and how to craft stuff' sorry but if 'inventory management' is a major part of this game, the devs did it wrong.

307210,Will Fight for Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game of the Hour,"Is 84 minutes with a snack break thrown in worth $5?  WFfF reminds me of the flash games I used to play back in the early 2000's. As I remember them, they had a charming, if not minimalist art style, interesting or zany premises and usually did one or two things pretty well for what they were. I think that's a fair generalization of this game.  The game starts off as the player character, who is a professional wrestler, shows up drunk to work and is about to take a fall, giving up the championship belt to another wrestler. After a few clicks through the dialogue and it's now the future. The player character is homeless and goes around a city map bumping into his old friends/rivals from the glory days of wrestling in the WFF. Some are just as down on luck as the player character, others have become high ranking officials in the police department of even government. The player will then decide to talk or fight to solve these former wrestlers' problems.  Humor is a hard thing to capture in a game because humor is not universal. Something funny to someone can be an annoyance to the next. The humor in WFfF is zany and irreverent so I found myself smirking a couple times while playing the game. It's hit or miss but doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to be funny which is a good thing.   The humor serves the dialogue well and the highlight of the game is probably the dialogue system. In certain situations the player will have to convince characters to do things they may not want to do, a screen pops up displaying certain traits about the person the character is talking to and it's up to the player to decide how to tackle the situation. Adopting an agressive style, disagree with the character and do so in a snarky way and the person that needs the convincing may disapprove while assuming a different stance, agreeing with the person and being a little more to the point may be the required combination. It's definitely an interesting and organic way to handle dialogue and when it works, things go pretty smooth, when it doesn't work, I was forced to throw up my dukes and handle things through combat.  Combat is a little too simplistic for my liking, even in a game such as this. There are punches, kicks, and a shoulder charge with rapid pressing of these buttons stringing the attacks into a combo which changes the animation a little bit. My issues are the AI isn't that bright and the combat moves don't feel particularly wrestling-esque. AI will often close distance and get within melee range but since this game plays like an old beat 'em up, the characters can sometimes overlap on the x axis and instead of the computer trying to reposition itself, it will swing blindy over and over until the player moves the character around.  There's equipment in the game that changes stats such as damage and speed and the different stats do have a visible effect on how fast the character moves or the damage that they do but I only wish that there was a change to the appearance of the character too. I think it would be a little toucht hat goes a long way to show that the developer cared about the little things.  There's about 8 locations, a quest or two per map and one of those maps are unlocked once everything else has been solved. The graphics aren't that good with a lot of assets being reused and for some reason there are minigames of sorts that don't amount to anything and aren't very fun.  Oh I asked a question in the beginning and for me the answer is no. Those flash games were little time wasters that were occasionally fun but they were free and some of them were really well done with a bunch of little nuances throw in. Will Fight for Food has some good ideas but it doesn't seem much effort is put into the game to make those ideas shine.  ",-1,0,4713

However, when I finished it a day or so later, I felt a little disappointed.   This game overall feels more like a couple of long DLC missions in the main game than a stand alone game. It's entertaining enough if you liked Black Flag, because this is basically the same, but on a much smaller, less interesting scale. It feels like you're just playing as a reskinned Edward, as the idle animations are the exact same. You can hunt certain animals, but there's no purpose, because you can't craft or make more outfits. Like in Black Flag, you can plunder other ships, but the rewards are so badly scaled to the prices of the few upgrades, that you're basically decked out after you've pulverized four ships. Freedom Cry feels like someone cut a tiny square out of the bayeux tapestry. It's aesthetically pleasing in itself, but it's lacking a whole hell of a lot of context.   I personally don't feel like Freedom Cry's got enough content or weight to be its own game. I played it, I completed it, it was okay while it lasted, but in a critical light, this really isn't that big of a deal. I would't recommend buying this unless it's on sale.",-1,1,5633

268750,Magicite,"This game is completely amazing. There's a long list of districts/levels and I can't notice that many bugs in the game :D!

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

258970,Gauntlet™ ,"wasd only? Serious?  Agree that the 'Traditional Gauntlet' feel is not here.  Combat style is so far away from the arcade feel. It's feels more like a flash game.  Gauntlet was controls on left w/ buttons on the right for action. This is more action based on pointer location.  Then that introduction, where you're forced to play each class . . .   I'm not sure what they were going for, but I don't like what was delivered.  For me this goes on the shelf, at least until the controls are fixed, hopefully they have somone on the staff play the original, and possibly get a coder that isn't hell-bent on that hideous config.

270810,Jones On Fire," Jonas on Fire  it's a simple 2D side scrolling runner game where you have 2 buttons: jump and slide. It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. The player's mission is to guide a firefighter along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, the player will collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more. The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.  The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios. Graphically it's clearly based on  Minecraft  fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.   Jones of Fire  could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions,  Jones of Fire  doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.  I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.",-1,0,8239
35700,Trine,"TRINE IS NOT MADE FOR SINGLE PLAYER  Pros: -Fun and interestic platforming with plenty of unique puzzles -Great soundtrack -3 Player Co-Op -Looks nice -Decent story -Clever level design  Cons: -Very short -Trine was made for multiplayer. Single player is incredibly easy and allows you to skip over a majority of the puzzles with ease. -Knight felt useless to me -I personally thought the voice acting sucked  Overall: If you have 2 other friends who have this game, buy it, it will be worth your money. Otherwise, leave it alone, single player is short and easy. It was pretty disappointing to me.  Trine is certainly not a bad game, in fact, it's an excellent game. But it was made for multiplayer.

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting.

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679

353130,Time of Dragons,"This game...meh. I didn't really get into it. Not my style, you could say, but all things considered, I really just didn't like it. It might appeal to some, but I found the game to be fairly boring in nearly all areas. The dragons didn't seem very interesting or original, at least in my eyes, and were sometimes hard to control in the game itself. I found myelf getting shot from behind quite a lot, dying before I even knew what was happening. This could easily be attributed to my lack of skill in the game, but, ah, well, I really just found it hard not to get shot in the back.    One of the good points, I must add, is that the stats actually make a difference. I mean, some games get me confused as to why I need to up my stealth, or my stamina, or whatever else they can think up., but here it can be very clear as to the weaknesses and strengths of each dragon. That was nice, of course, but everything else sort of faded into the background. The art? I can barely remember it. The music? Was there any music at all in this game?   So, yeah, average game.

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative. Prison Architect is extremely addicting for me, it's challenging and it is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.",1,0,19156

233450,Prison Architect,"This game is amazingly addicting and way to much controlling every minute of prisoners lives. It should not be this fun. Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

233450,Prison Architect,"Really good management game. You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.  Cons : -Can't really think of anything, maybe some little bugs.",1,0,21417

271820,Card City Nights," Card City Nights is a true gem among the numerous games many indie studios release.   Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.  The deck building interface leaves some things to be desired, but is completely usable.   Card City Nights offers a fun challenge for both serious and casual gamers.  10/10",1,0,28028

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

Nevertheless it's also a ton of fun and it will encourage you to find the best solution to deal with each monster, due to the possibilities of customization and the equipment at your disposal, which is quite remarkable.

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a great sandbox game that gives a lot of room and possibilities for one's own creativity and to go full nerd-mod. Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play. There is a great development team behind the game and an even greater community that amazes again and again with their own creations and helping side. Even not being totally finished (last update planned for august 2016) it was all the way and will always be an enjoyable game.",1,0,46985

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

213330,LEGO® Batman™ 2: DC Super Heroes,"LEGO Batman 2 is the first LEGO game that I’ve actually finished. Well, I may be slightly abusing the term “finished” here. My playthrough ended recently at 22.3%. So “abandoned” might be a more apt characterization, although in fairness to me, I did complete the story mode. I started playing the first game in this series and abandoned it fairly early on, probably due to the fact that the keyboard-and-mouse controls are abominable. Setting up a controller to play and actually playing with a controller are a breeze but do not–under any circumstances–attempt to play this game without one.  All of the LEGO games are built on a similar foundation: smashing enemies and collecting bricks/studs with which to purchase unlocks/abilities. There is some platforming involved but puzzles are essentially limited to figuring out which superpower/suit is needed to remove an obstacle to progress. As such the gameplay is amusing in short bursts but tiresome over the long haul, especially if you’re 1) over the age of 10; and 2) playing by yourself.  The story is a slight but entertaining tale that begins with The Joker and various other Bat-villains robbing the guests at Gotham’s Man of the Year awards ceremony and segues into Lex Luthor recruiting The Joker to aid him in his bid to win the presidency of the United States. Batman and Robin eventually have to call Superman to help out, and eventually, with the Last Son of Krypton greatly weakened by exposure to Kryptonite, the JLA shows up to aid in the capture of the evil duo. (Interestingly, Superman is almost too powerful in this game, as he’s essentially invulnerable to harm and has abilities that the Dynamic Duo need four different suits to replicate.) The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and once you get past the major conceit that all of these characters are essentially self-aware toys, it’s pretty funny.  Once you’ve completed the story in LEGO Batman 2, you can take any currently-unlocked character and faff about in Gotham City, looking for imperiled citizens to rescue or miscreants to defeat. Although the game drops frequent hints about nearly every other aspect of gameplay, the method of actually unlocking characters remains somewhat obscure. Occasionally during a fight (for characters) or while wandering the cityscape and passing near an object (for vehicles), you will receive a button prompt and a message advising you that you can purchase that item for x number of studs. Once you do, that item is added to your roster/garage. In the course of your travels, you will discover items that can only be interacted with using the abilities of specific characters such as Poison Ivy, Man-Bat, or The Joker. However, actually obtaining those characters appears to be a surprisingly trial-and-error affair. Upon completion of the story, I had Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and a few assorted goons unlocked for a grand total of 12 out of 60 unlockable characters. (You can also replay any section of the story in “Free Play” mode (meaning with access to any unlocked character), but of course this approach suffers from the same shortcomings I mentioned above.)  The game looks and sounds great, but we come back to the fundamental problem of gameplay and the nature of LEGO games. These are games that are meant for kids and co-op. They are meant to be played several times, uncovering more bits and bobs on each playthrough. These are all concepts that are antithetical to the way that I play games. I don’t have kids or a gamer spouse and I rarely play through a game more than once. Kids don’t really mind repetition and doing the same thing ad nauseum; in fact, I’d venture to say psychologists probably have some term for a childhood phase during which they absolutely thrive on it. As an adult, I don’t normally bother with replays simply because if a game offers nothing new on a replay other than a different character, it doesn’t have enough novel content to justify spending my time.",-1,0,388

268750,Magicite,"Starting with positive, I like the controls they feel tight and responsive so far, I like the artstyle, and in general I actually really like the concept of this, Feels more like an arcade version of terreria.  BUT almost instantly, out of principle I have to give it a no just because the crafting is so annoying.  I didn't realize it would be so unintuitive. clunkily halving ingrediants then crafting 15 sword hilts or whatever because I don't know how to grab just 1 at a time and couldn't even if I wanted to because the inventory is stupidly small.  another game with unnecessary amounts of time researching recipes online as I play. Sure after a week or so I will probably get most of it down but the thing is It adds NOTHING to the game, it only takes away from it.  For a game that feels much like an arcadey platformer pop-in-for-a-half-hour-session type of game, I really don't understand what they were thinking with the crafting.   The game is at it's core a a relatively simple action/rpg arcade platformer style level based game. design the game as such IMO, it seems to have some identity issues going on.  add up resources like you do the gold, Have some sort of crafting menu that simply shows you what you can craft and what you need.  Simply click if you have the ingrediants.  wow was that so hard? probably would have saved me 3-4 hours of wiki'ing. and if someone were to argue 'well that's the fun, you need to be smart about your space and how to craft stuff' sorry but if 'inventory management' is a major part of this game, the devs did it wrong.

307210,Will Fight for Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game of the Hour,"Is 84 minutes with a snack break thrown in worth $5?  WFfF reminds me of the flash games I used to play back in the early 2000's. As I remember them, they had a charming, if not minimalist art style, interesting or zany premises and usually did one or two things pretty well for what they were. I think that's a fair generalization of this game.  The game starts off as the player character, who is a professional wrestler, shows up drunk to work and is about to take a fall, giving up the championship belt to another wrestler. After a few clicks through the dialogue and it's now the future. The player character is homeless and goes around a city map bumping into his old friends/rivals from the glory days of wrestling in the WFF. Some are just as down on luck as the player character, others have become high ranking officials in the police department of even government. The player will then decide to talk or fight to solve these former wrestlers' problems.  Humor is a hard thing to capture in a game because humor is not universal. Something funny to someone can be an annoyance to the next. The humor in WFfF is zany and irreverent so I found myself smirking a couple times while playing the game. It's hit or miss but doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to be funny which is a good thing.   The humor serves the dialogue well and the highlight of the game is probably the dialogue system. In certain situations the player will have to convince characters to do things they may not want to do, a screen pops up displaying certain traits about the person the character is talking to and it's up to the player to decide how to tackle the situation. Adopting an agressive style, disagree with the character and do so in a snarky way and the person that needs the convincing may disapprove while assuming a different stance, agreeing with the person and being a little more to the point may be the required combination. It's definitely an interesting and organic way to handle dialogue and when it works, things go pretty smooth, when it doesn't work, I was forced to throw up my dukes and handle things through combat.  Combat is a little too simplistic for my liking, even in a game such as this. There are punches, kicks, and a shoulder charge with rapid pressing of these buttons stringing the attacks into a combo which changes the animation a little bit. My issues are the AI isn't that bright and the combat moves don't feel particularly wrestling-esque. AI will often close distance and get within melee range but since this game plays like an old beat 'em up, the characters can sometimes overlap on the x axis and instead of the computer trying to reposition itself, it will swing blindy over and over until the player moves the character around.  There's equipment in the game that changes stats such as damage and speed and the different stats do have a visible effect on how fast the character moves or the damage that they do but I only wish that there was a change to the appearance of the character too. I think it would be a little toucht hat goes a long way to show that the developer cared about the little things.  There's about 8 locations, a quest or two per map and one of those maps are unlocked once everything else has been solved. The graphics aren't that good with a lot of assets being reused and for some reason there are minigames of sorts that don't amount to anything and aren't very fun.  Oh I asked a question in the beginning and for me the answer is no. Those flash games were little time wasters that were occasionally fun but they were free and some of them were really well done with a bunch of little nuances throw in. Will Fight for Food has some good ideas but it doesn't seem much effort is put into the game to make those ideas shine.  ",-1,0,4713
19980,Prince of Persia,"Prince of Persia (2008) is a super easy game with a cool art style and a Zelda-like combat system. It is a very peaceful and relaxing game.

277590,Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry,"Now, as a long term Assassin's Creed fan I was super god damn excited to play this game when I saw it on sale. However, when I finished it a day or so later, I felt a little disappointed.   This game overall feels more like a couple of long DLC missions in the main game than a stand alone game. It's entertaining enough if you liked Black Flag, because this is basically the same, but on a much smaller, less interesting scale. It feels like you're just playing as a reskinned Edward, as the idle animations are the exact same. You can hunt certain animals, but there's no purpose, because you can't craft or make more outfits. Like in Black Flag, you can plunder other ships, but the rewards are so badly scaled to the prices of the few upgrades, that you're basically decked out after you've pulverized four ships. Freedom Cry feels like someone cut a tiny square out of the bayeux tapestry. It's aesthetically pleasing in itself, but it's lacking a whole hell of a lot of context.   I personally don't feel like Freedom Cry's got enough content or weight to be its own game. I played it, I completed it, it was okay while it lasted, but in a critical light, this really isn't that big of a deal. I would't recommend buying this unless it's on sale.",-1,1,5633

But there are two things I'd liked to say about it:  -There's a bug when you glide down with the hive goggles, not bad, but a bit annoying, it sort of glitches around.  -Can the developers please add a save game proccess?? That would help out a TONNE.  Overall, I love the game, thanks for making it &lt;3 :D",1,0,9500

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

258970,Gauntlet™ ,"wasd only? Serious?  Agree that the 'Traditional Gauntlet' feel is not here.  Combat style is so far away from the arcade feel. It's feels more like a flash game.  Gauntlet was controls on left w/ buttons on the right for action. This is more action based on pointer location.  Then that introduction, where you're forced to play each class . . .   I'm not sure what they were going for, but I don't like what was delivered.  For me this goes on the shelf, at least until the controls are fixed, hopefully they have somone on the staff play the original, and possibly get a coder that isn't hell-bent on that hideous config.  STEAM should warn 'WASD ONLY' then southpaws would know the game is UNPLAYABLE.",-1,0,7387

268750,Magicite,"It's a lazy 2d minecraft. Some may argue that that's what people said about Terraria. The only difference is that Terraria is an experience unlike any other game of its caliber, whereas this game is the equivalent of something I could find on a backwater flash game website. Clearly I'm in the minority when it comes to this opinion. For the life of me I can't see why.

270810,Jones On Fire," Jonas on Fire  it's a simple 2D side scrolling runner game where you have 2 buttons: jump and slide. It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. The player's mission is to guide a firefighter along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, the player will collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more. The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.  The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios. Graphically it's clearly based on  Minecraft  fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.   Jones of Fire  could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions,  Jones of Fire  doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.  I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.",-1,0,8239
35700,Trine,"TRINE IS NOT MADE FOR SINGLE PLAYER  Pros: -Fun and interestic platforming with plenty of unique puzzles -Great soundtrack -3 Player Co-Op -Looks nice -Decent story -Clever level design  Cons: -Very short -Trine was made for multiplayer. Single player is incredibly easy and allows you to skip over a majority of the puzzles with ease. -Knight felt useless to me -I personally thought the voice acting sucked  Overall: If you have 2 other friends who have this game, buy it, it will be worth your money. Otherwise, leave it alone, single player is short and easy. It was pretty disappointing to me.  Trine is certainly not a bad game, in fact, it's an excellent game. But it was made for multiplayer.

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting.

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679

Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background.

353130,Time of Dragons,"This game...meh. I didn't really get into it. Not my style, you could say, but all things considered, I really just didn't like it. It might appeal to some, but I found the game to be fairly boring in nearly all areas. The dragons didn't seem very interesting or original, at least in my eyes, and were sometimes hard to control in the game itself. I found myelf getting shot from behind quite a lot, dying before I even knew what was happening. This could easily be attributed to my lack of skill in the game, but, ah, well, I really just found it hard not to get shot in the back.    One of the good points, I must add, is that the stats actually make a difference. I mean, some games get me confused as to why I need to up my stealth, or my stamina, or whatever else they can think up., but here it can be very clear as to the weaknesses and strengths of each dragon. That was nice, of course, but everything else sort of faded into the background. The art? I can barely remember it. The music? Was there any music at all in this game?   So, yeah, average game. Could just be my opinion, but I didn't like it. Play it if you want, but don't expect me to recommend it.",-1,1,9441

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative. Prison Architect is extremely addicting for me, it's challenging and it is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.",1,0,19156

233450,Prison Architect,"This game is amazingly addicting and way to much controlling every minute of prisoners lives. It should not be this fun. Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

233450,Prison Architect,"Really good management game. You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.  Cons : -Can't really think of anything, maybe some little bugs.",1,0,21417

It is a trippy FPS style game where you play a robot on a single wheel (so the movement is purposefully floaty) and you play dodgeball in a crazy discotech with awesome music and cool light effects.   There is few community, mainly because I don't think people really remember to play this game, not because its boring or bad. I have a blast whenever I play, or until I ragequit from arcade mode. =P  Anyways, pick it up on a sale to give it a try, or better yet, grab a four pack so we can get some more people in there to play this fun game!",1,1,24187

233450,Prison Architect,Great Game where you create the content so it is endless. I have put over 100 hours in this game and would definitely recommend BUT if you plan to make very big prisons make sure to have a pretty fast computer because once you get about 1000 people moving in your prison your game starts to lag so that is something to keep in mind.,1,0,24812

271820,Card City Nights," Card City Nights is a true gem among the numerous games many indie studios release.   Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.  The deck building interface leaves some things to be desired, but is completely usable.   Card City Nights offers a fun challenge for both serious and casual gamers.  10/10",1,0,28028

268750,Magicite,"Firstly , Magicite is an amazing game with 9/10 graphics. But its very hard which adds challenge so it wont be like ' Hey , TAKE THIS WITH YOU ' or something like that. There are alot of gamers who dont like hard games. I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now. Or there could be a trade feature where players can trade OP , Non-OP weapons and armors through trade , and the comunity market.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

233450,Prison Architect,"I adore this game, you should aswell, best prison simulator around. And far worth the price. I backed it on early access and watched it grow into the fine game it is today. The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing.

This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

213330,LEGO® Batman™ 2: DC Super Heroes,"LEGO Batman 2 is the first LEGO game that I’ve actually finished. Well, I may be slightly abusing the term “finished” here. My playthrough ended recently at 22.3%. So “abandoned” might be a more apt characterization, although in fairness to me, I did complete the story mode. I started playing the first game in this series and abandoned it fairly early on, probably due to the fact that the keyboard-and-mouse controls are abominable. Setting up a controller to play and actually playing with a controller are a breeze but do not–under any circumstances–attempt to play this game without one.  All of the LEGO games are built on a similar foundation: smashing enemies and collecting bricks/studs with which to purchase unlocks/abilities. There is some platforming involved but puzzles are essentially limited to figuring out which superpower/suit is needed to remove an obstacle to progress. As such the gameplay is amusing in short bursts but tiresome over the long haul, especially if you’re 1) over the age of 10; and 2) playing by yourself.  The story is a slight but entertaining tale that begins with The Joker and various other Bat-villains robbing the guests at Gotham’s Man of the Year awards ceremony and segues into Lex Luthor recruiting The Joker to aid him in his bid to win the presidency of the United States. Batman and Robin eventually have to call Superman to help out, and eventually, with the Last Son of Krypton greatly weakened by exposure to Kryptonite, the JLA shows up to aid in the capture of the evil duo. (Interestingly, Superman is almost too powerful in this game, as he’s essentially invulnerable to harm and has abilities that the Dynamic Duo need four different suits to replicate.) The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and once you get past the major conceit that all of these characters are essentially self-aware toys, it’s pretty funny.  Once you’ve completed the story in LEGO Batman 2, you can take any currently-unlocked character and faff about in Gotham City, looking for imperiled citizens to rescue or miscreants to defeat. Although the game drops frequent hints about nearly every other aspect of gameplay, the method of actually unlocking characters remains somewhat obscure. Occasionally during a fight (for characters) or while wandering the cityscape and passing near an object (for vehicles), you will receive a button prompt and a message advising you that you can purchase that item for x number of studs. Once you do, that item is added to your roster/garage. In the course of your travels, you will discover items that can only be interacted with using the abilities of specific characters such as Poison Ivy, Man-Bat, or The Joker. However, actually obtaining those characters appears to be a surprisingly trial-and-error affair. Upon completion of the story, I had Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and a few assorted goons unlocked for a grand total of 12 out of 60 unlockable characters. (You can also replay any section of the story in “Free Play” mode (meaning with access to any unlocked character), but of course this approach suffers from the same shortcomings I mentioned above.)  The game looks and sounds great, but we come back to the fundamental problem of gameplay and the nature of LEGO games. These are games that are meant for kids and co-op. They are meant to be played several times, uncovering more bits and bobs on each playthrough. These are all concepts that are antithetical to the way that I play games. I don’t have kids or a gamer spouse and I rarely play through a game more than once. Kids don’t really mind repetition and doing the same thing ad nauseum; in fact, I’d venture to say psychologists probably have some term for a childhood phase during which they absolutely thrive on it. As an adult, I don’t normally bother with replays simply because if a game offers nothing new on a replay other than a different character, it doesn’t have enough novel content to justify spending my time.",-1,0,388

268750,Magicite,"Starting with positive, I like the controls they feel tight and responsive so far, I like the artstyle, and in general I actually really like the concept of this, Feels more like an arcade version of terreria.  BUT almost instantly, out of principle I have to give it a no just because the crafting is so annoying.  I didn't realize it would be so unintuitive. clunkily halving ingrediants then crafting 15 sword hilts or whatever because I don't know how to grab just 1 at a time and couldn't even if I wanted to because the inventory is stupidly small.  another game with unnecessary amounts of time researching recipes online as I play. Sure after a week or so I will probably get most of it down but the thing is It adds NOTHING to the game, it only takes away from it.  For a game that feels much like an arcadey platformer pop-in-for-a-half-hour-session type of game, I really don't understand what they were thinking with the crafting.   The game is at it's core a a relatively simple action/rpg arcade platformer style level based game. design the game as such IMO, it seems to have some identity issues going on.  add up resources like you do the gold, Have some sort of crafting menu that simply shows you what you can craft and what you need.  Simply click if you have the ingrediants.  wow was that so hard? probably would have saved me 3-4 hours of wiki'ing. and if someone were to argue 'well that's the fun, you need to be smart about your space and how to craft stuff' sorry but if 'inventory management' is a major part of this game, the devs did it wrong.

I played only for a few hours and already got bored of the 'fight enemies for 5 minutes and collect orbs for an hour'-policy. Not to mention the complexity of the actual combat...

307210,Will Fight for Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game of the Hour,"Is 84 minutes with a snack break thrown in worth $5?  WFfF reminds me of the flash games I used to play back in the early 2000's. As I remember them, they had a charming, if not minimalist art style, interesting or zany premises and usually did one or two things pretty well for what they were. I think that's a fair generalization of this game.  The game starts off as the player character, who is a professional wrestler, shows up drunk to work and is about to take a fall, giving up the championship belt to another wrestler. After a few clicks through the dialogue and it's now the future. The player character is homeless and goes around a city map bumping into his old friends/rivals from the glory days of wrestling in the WFF. Some are just as down on luck as the player character, others have become high ranking officials in the police department of even government. The player will then decide to talk or fight to solve these former wrestlers' problems.  Humor is a hard thing to capture in a game because humor is not universal. Something funny to someone can be an annoyance to the next. The humor in WFfF is zany and irreverent so I found myself smirking a couple times while playing the game. It's hit or miss but doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to be funny which is a good thing.   The humor serves the dialogue well and the highlight of the game is probably the dialogue system. In certain situations the player will have to convince characters to do things they may not want to do, a screen pops up displaying certain traits about the person the character is talking to and it's up to the player to decide how to tackle the situation. Adopting an agressive style, disagree with the character and do so in a snarky way and the person that needs the convincing may disapprove while assuming a different stance, agreeing with the person and being a little more to the point may be the required combination. It's definitely an interesting and organic way to handle dialogue and when it works, things go pretty smooth, when it doesn't work, I was forced to throw up my dukes and handle things through combat.  Combat is a little too simplistic for my liking, even in a game such as this. There are punches, kicks, and a shoulder charge with rapid pressing of these buttons stringing the attacks into a combo which changes the animation a little bit. My issues are the AI isn't that bright and the combat moves don't feel particularly wrestling-esque. AI will often close distance and get within melee range but since this game plays like an old beat 'em up, the characters can sometimes overlap on the x axis and instead of the computer trying to reposition itself, it will swing blindy over and over until the player moves the character around.  There's equipment in the game that changes stats such as damage and speed and the different stats do have a visible effect on how fast the character moves or the damage that they do but I only wish that there was a change to the appearance of the character too. I think it would be a little toucht hat goes a long way to show that the developer cared about the little things.  There's about 8 locations, a quest or two per map and one of those maps are unlocked once everything else has been solved. The graphics aren't that good with a lot of assets being reused and for some reason there are minigames of sorts that don't amount to anything and aren't very fun.  Oh I asked a question in the beginning and for me the answer is no. Those flash games were little time wasters that were occasionally fun but they were free and some of them were really well done with a bunch of little nuances throw in. Will Fight for Food has some good ideas but it doesn't seem much effort is put into the game to make those ideas shine.  ",-1,0,4713
19980,Prince of Persia,"Prince of Persia (2008) is a super easy game with a cool art style and a Zelda-like combat system. It is a very peaceful and relaxing game.

277590,Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry,"Now, as a long term Assassin's Creed fan I was super god damn excited to play this game when I saw it on sale. However, when I finished it a day or so later, I felt a little disappointed.   This game overall feels more like a couple of long DLC missions in the main game than a stand alone game. It's entertaining enough if you liked Black Flag, because this is basically the same, but on a much smaller, less interesting scale. It feels like you're just playing as a reskinned Edward, as the idle animations are the exact same. You can hunt certain animals, but there's no purpose, because you can't craft or make more outfits. Like in Black Flag, you can plunder other ships, but the rewards are so badly scaled to the prices of the few upgrades, that you're basically decked out after you've pulverized four ships. Freedom Cry feels like someone cut a tiny square out of the bayeux tapestry. It's aesthetically pleasing in itself, but it's lacking a whole hell of a lot of context.   I personally don't feel like Freedom Cry's got enough content or weight to be its own game. I played it, I completed it, it was okay while it lasted, but in a critical light, this really isn't that big of a deal. I would't recommend buying this unless it's on sale.",-1,1,5633

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

258970,Gauntlet™ ,"wasd only? Serious?  Agree that the 'Traditional Gauntlet' feel is not here.  Combat style is so far away from the arcade feel. It's feels more like a flash game.  Gauntlet was controls on left w/ buttons on the right for action. This is more action based on pointer location.  Then that introduction, where you're forced to play each class . . .   I'm not sure what they were going for, but I don't like what was delivered.  For me this goes on the shelf, at least until the controls are fixed, hopefully they have somone on the staff play the original, and possibly get a coder that isn't hell-bent on that hideous config.  STEAM should warn 'WASD ONLY' then southpaws would know the game is UNPLAYABLE.",-1,0,7387

Otherwise, leave it alone, single player is short and easy. It was pretty disappointing to me.  Trine is certainly not a bad game, in fact, it's an excellent game. But it was made for multiplayer.

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679
270810,Jones On Fire," Jonas on Fire  it's a simple 2D side scrolling runner game where you have 2 buttons: jump and slide. It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. The player's mission is to guide a firefighter along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, the player will collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more. The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.  The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios. Graphically it's clearly based on  Minecraft  fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.   Jones of Fire  could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions,  Jones of Fire  doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.  I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.",-1,0,8239

The dragons didn't seem very interesting or original, at least in my eyes, and were sometimes hard to control in the game itself. I found myelf getting shot from behind quite a lot, dying before I even knew what was happening. This could easily be attributed to my lack of skill in the game, but, ah, well, I really just found it hard not to get shot in the back.    One of the good points, I must add, is that the stats actually make a difference. I mean, some games get me confused as to why I need to up my stealth, or my stamina, or whatever else they can think up., but here it can be very clear as to the weaknesses and strengths of each dragon. That was nice, of course, but everything else sort of faded into the background. The art? I can barely remember it. The music? Was there any music at all in this game?   So, yeah, average game.

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.

No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

233450,Prison Architect,"Really good management game. You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.  Cons : -Can't really think of anything, maybe some little bugs.",1,0,21417

271820,Card City Nights," Card City Nights is a true gem among the numerous games many indie studios release.   Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.  The deck building interface leaves some things to be desired, but is completely usable.   Card City Nights offers a fun challenge for both serious and casual gamers.  10/10",1,0,28028

I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147

This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.

233450,Prison Architect,"This is by far one of my more favorite games. Every prison has a different outcome. Be it flows smooth and steady, or the prisoners get roudy and up-in-arms and start riots to big for riot police to handle.  11/10 -Would enrage all the prisoners again",1,1,37564

268750,Magicite,Really good game but the Online can be very buggy. (The game will think each player is at different points on the world and then will casue it to crash - losing any rewards that you should have got on that run through.),1,0,37678

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This RPG is undoubtedly hard, very hard. The enemies are tough (honorable mention for the elemental ones. They will become your nightmare) and some puzzles are difficult to solve and a bit frustrating at times. Nevertheless it's also a ton of fun and it will encourage you to find the best solution to deal with each monster, due to the possibilities of customization and the equipment at your disposal, which is quite remarkable.  Legend of Grimrock 2 is probably not a game for everyone, but if you are looking for something challenging then give it a shot.",1,0,40903

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,Awesome game. Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve because it lacks a proper ingame guide.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play.

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

213330,LEGO® Batman™ 2: DC Super Heroes,"LEGO Batman 2 is the first LEGO game that I’ve actually finished. Well, I may be slightly abusing the term “finished” here. My playthrough ended recently at 22.3%. So “abandoned” might be a more apt characterization, although in fairness to me, I did complete the story mode. I started playing the first game in this series and abandoned it fairly early on, probably due to the fact that the keyboard-and-mouse controls are abominable. Setting up a controller to play and actually playing with a controller are a breeze but do not–under any circumstances–attempt to play this game without one.  All of the LEGO games are built on a similar foundation: smashing enemies and collecting bricks/studs with which to purchase unlocks/abilities. There is some platforming involved but puzzles are essentially limited to figuring out which superpower/suit is needed to remove an obstacle to progress. As such the gameplay is amusing in short bursts but tiresome over the long haul, especially if you’re 1) over the age of 10; and 2) playing by yourself.  The story is a slight but entertaining tale that begins with The Joker and various other Bat-villains robbing the guests at Gotham’s Man of the Year awards ceremony and segues into Lex Luthor recruiting The Joker to aid him in his bid to win the presidency of the United States. Batman and Robin eventually have to call Superman to help out, and eventually, with the Last Son of Krypton greatly weakened by exposure to Kryptonite, the JLA shows up to aid in the capture of the evil duo. (Interestingly, Superman is almost too powerful in this game, as he’s essentially invulnerable to harm and has abilities that the Dynamic Duo need four different suits to replicate.) The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and once you get past the major conceit that all of these characters are essentially self-aware toys, it’s pretty funny.  Once you’ve completed the story in LEGO Batman 2, you can take any currently-unlocked character and faff about in Gotham City, looking for imperiled citizens to rescue or miscreants to defeat. Although the game drops frequent hints about nearly every other aspect of gameplay, the method of actually unlocking characters remains somewhat obscure. Occasionally during a fight (for characters) or while wandering the cityscape and passing near an object (for vehicles), you will receive a button prompt and a message advising you that you can purchase that item for x number of studs. Once you do, that item is added to your roster/garage. In the course of your travels, you will discover items that can only be interacted with using the abilities of specific characters such as Poison Ivy, Man-Bat, or The Joker. However, actually obtaining those characters appears to be a surprisingly trial-and-error affair. Upon completion of the story, I had Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and a few assorted goons unlocked for a grand total of 12 out of 60 unlockable characters. (You can also replay any section of the story in “Free Play” mode (meaning with access to any unlocked character), but of course this approach suffers from the same shortcomings I mentioned above.)  The game looks and sounds great, but we come back to the fundamental problem of gameplay and the nature of LEGO games. These are games that are meant for kids and co-op. They are meant to be played several times, uncovering more bits and bobs on each playthrough. These are all concepts that are antithetical to the way that I play games. I don’t have kids or a gamer spouse and I rarely play through a game more than once. Kids don’t really mind repetition and doing the same thing ad nauseum; in fact, I’d venture to say psychologists probably have some term for a childhood phase during which they absolutely thrive on it. As an adult, I don’t normally bother with replays simply because if a game offers nothing new on a replay other than a different character, it doesn’t have enough novel content to justify spending my time.",-1,0,388

268750,Magicite,"Starting with positive, I like the controls they feel tight and responsive so far, I like the artstyle, and in general I actually really like the concept of this, Feels more like an arcade version of terreria.  BUT almost instantly, out of principle I have to give it a no just because the crafting is so annoying.  I didn't realize it would be so unintuitive. clunkily halving ingrediants then crafting 15 sword hilts or whatever because I don't know how to grab just 1 at a time and couldn't even if I wanted to because the inventory is stupidly small.  another game with unnecessary amounts of time researching recipes online as I play. Sure after a week or so I will probably get most of it down but the thing is It adds NOTHING to the game, it only takes away from it.  For a game that feels much like an arcadey platformer pop-in-for-a-half-hour-session type of game, I really don't understand what they were thinking with the crafting.   The game is at it's core a a relatively simple action/rpg arcade platformer style level based game. design the game as such IMO, it seems to have some identity issues going on.  add up resources like you do the gold, Have some sort of crafting menu that simply shows you what you can craft and what you need.  Simply click if you have the ingrediants.  wow was that so hard? probably would have saved me 3-4 hours of wiki'ing. and if someone were to argue 'well that's the fun, you need to be smart about your space and how to craft stuff' sorry but if 'inventory management' is a major part of this game, the devs did it wrong.  Magicite. A game that doesn't know what it wants to be.",-1,1,1899

I played only for a few hours and already got bored of the 'fight enemies for 5 minutes and collect orbs for an hour'-policy. Not to mention the complexity of the actual combat...

307210,Will Fight for Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game of the Hour,"Is 84 minutes with a snack break thrown in worth $5?  WFfF reminds me of the flash games I used to play back in the early 2000's. As I remember them, they had a charming, if not minimalist art style, interesting or zany premises and usually did one or two things pretty well for what they were. I think that's a fair generalization of this game.  The game starts off as the player character, who is a professional wrestler, shows up drunk to work and is about to take a fall, giving up the championship belt to another wrestler. After a few clicks through the dialogue and it's now the future. The player character is homeless and goes around a city map bumping into his old friends/rivals from the glory days of wrestling in the WFF. Some are just as down on luck as the player character, others have become high ranking officials in the police department of even government. The player will then decide to talk or fight to solve these former wrestlers' problems.  Humor is a hard thing to capture in a game because humor is not universal. Something funny to someone can be an annoyance to the next. The humor in WFfF is zany and irreverent so I found myself smirking a couple times while playing the game. It's hit or miss but doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to be funny which is a good thing.   The humor serves the dialogue well and the highlight of the game is probably the dialogue system. In certain situations the player will have to convince characters to do things they may not want to do, a screen pops up displaying certain traits about the person the character is talking to and it's up to the player to decide how to tackle the situation. Adopting an agressive style, disagree with the character and do so in a snarky way and the person that needs the convincing may disapprove while assuming a different stance, agreeing with the person and being a little more to the point may be the required combination. It's definitely an interesting and organic way to handle dialogue and when it works, things go pretty smooth, when it doesn't work, I was forced to throw up my dukes and handle things through combat.  Combat is a little too simplistic for my liking, even in a game such as this. There are punches, kicks, and a shoulder charge with rapid pressing of these buttons stringing the attacks into a combo which changes the animation a little bit. My issues are the AI isn't that bright and the combat moves don't feel particularly wrestling-esque. AI will often close distance and get within melee range but since this game plays like an old beat 'em up, the characters can sometimes overlap on the x axis and instead of the computer trying to reposition itself, it will swing blindy over and over until the player moves the character around.  There's equipment in the game that changes stats such as damage and speed and the different stats do have a visible effect on how fast the character moves or the damage that they do but I only wish that there was a change to the appearance of the character too. I think it would be a little toucht hat goes a long way to show that the developer cared about the little things.  There's about 8 locations, a quest or two per map and one of those maps are unlocked once everything else has been solved. The graphics aren't that good with a lot of assets being reused and for some reason there are minigames of sorts that don't amount to anything and aren't very fun.  Oh I asked a question in the beginning and for me the answer is no. Those flash games were little time wasters that were occasionally fun but they were free and some of them were really well done with a bunch of little nuances throw in. Will Fight for Food has some good ideas but it doesn't seem much effort is put into the game to make those ideas shine.  ",-1,0,4713

277590,Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry,"Now, as a long term Assassin's Creed fan I was super god damn excited to play this game when I saw it on sale. However, when I finished it a day or so later, I felt a little disappointed.   This game overall feels more like a couple of long DLC missions in the main game than a stand alone game. It's entertaining enough if you liked Black Flag, because this is basically the same, but on a much smaller, less interesting scale. It feels like you're just playing as a reskinned Edward, as the idle animations are the exact same. You can hunt certain animals, but there's no purpose, because you can't craft or make more outfits. Like in Black Flag, you can plunder other ships, but the rewards are so badly scaled to the prices of the few upgrades, that you're basically decked out after you've pulverized four ships. Freedom Cry feels like someone cut a tiny square out of the bayeux tapestry. It's aesthetically pleasing in itself, but it's lacking a whole hell of a lot of context.   I personally don't feel like Freedom Cry's got enough content or weight to be its own game. I played it, I completed it, it was okay while it lasted, but in a critical light, this really isn't that big of a deal. I would't recommend buying this unless it's on sale.",-1,1,5633

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
268750,Magicite,"It's a lazy 2d minecraft. Some may argue that that's what people said about Terraria.

Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.

For the most part its all about timing and not running out of health or energy. The puzzles are easy, and the fights arent hard, but add in a bit of fumbling to jump/move properly or position a block quickly/precisely and you run into annoyingly road-blocks/set-backs.

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679
270810,Jones On Fire," Jonas on Fire  it's a simple 2D side scrolling runner game where you have 2 buttons: jump and slide. It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. The player's mission is to guide a firefighter along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, the player will collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more. The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.  The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios. Graphically it's clearly based on  Minecraft  fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.   Jones of Fire  could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions,  Jones of Fire  doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.  I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.",-1,0,8239
233450,Prison Architect,"Fantastic game! very addicting. The game mechanics are well done, the gameplay is fun and entertaining. You can build your own prison from nothing to a massive 500 cell mega facility. You can do everything from scheduling classes to death row appeals. Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background. The game is also completely missing any sort of main menu when you first launch the game. I highly recommend this game and I rate it 4 out of 5.",1,0,13068

It might appeal to some, but I found the game to be fairly boring in nearly all areas. The dragons didn't seem very interesting or original, at least in my eyes, and were sometimes hard to control in the game itself. I found myelf getting shot from behind quite a lot, dying before I even knew what was happening. This could easily be attributed to my lack of skill in the game, but, ah, well, I really just found it hard not to get shot in the back.    One of the good points, I must add, is that the stats actually make a difference. I mean, some games get me confused as to why I need to up my stealth, or my stamina, or whatever else they can think up., but here it can be very clear as to the weaknesses and strengths of each dragon. That was nice, of course, but everything else sort of faded into the background. The art? I can barely remember it. The music? Was there any music at all in this game?   So, yeah, average game.

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative.

Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.

Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

It is a trippy FPS style game where you play a robot on a single wheel (so the movement is purposefully floaty) and you play dodgeball in a crazy discotech with awesome music and cool light effects.   There is few community, mainly because I don't think people really remember to play this game, not because its boring or bad. I have a blast whenever I play, or until I ragequit from arcade mode. =P  Anyways, pick it up on a sale to give it a try, or better yet, grab a four pack so we can get some more people in there to play this fun game!",1,1,24187

233450,Prison Architect,Great Game where you create the content so it is endless.

271820,Card City Nights," Card City Nights is a true gem among the numerous games many indie studios release.   Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.  The deck building interface leaves some things to be desired, but is completely usable.   Card City Nights offers a fun challenge for both serious and casual gamers.  10/10",1,0,28028

268750,Magicite,"Firstly , Magicite is an amazing game with 9/10 graphics. But its very hard which adds challenge so it wont be like ' Hey , TAKE THIS WITH YOU ' or something like that. There are alot of gamers who dont like hard games. I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now. Or there could be a trade feature where players can trade OP , Non-OP weapons and armors through trade , and the comunity market.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

233450,Prison Architect,"I adore this game, you should aswell, best prison simulator around. And far worth the price. I backed it on early access and watched it grow into the fine game it is today. The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147

This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

They will become your nightmare) and some puzzles are difficult to solve and a bit frustrating at times. Nevertheless it's also a ton of fun and it will encourage you to find the best solution to deal with each monster, due to the possibilities of customization and the equipment at your disposal, which is quite remarkable.  Legend of Grimrock 2 is probably not a game for everyone, but if you are looking for something challenging then give it a shot.",1,0,40903

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

213330,LEGO® Batman™ 2: DC Super Heroes,"LEGO Batman 2 is the first LEGO game that I’ve actually finished. Well, I may be slightly abusing the term “finished” here. My playthrough ended recently at 22.3%. So “abandoned” might be a more apt characterization, although in fairness to me, I did complete the story mode. I started playing the first game in this series and abandoned it fairly early on, probably due to the fact that the keyboard-and-mouse controls are abominable. Setting up a controller to play and actually playing with a controller are a breeze but do not–under any circumstances–attempt to play this game without one.  All of the LEGO games are built on a similar foundation: smashing enemies and collecting bricks/studs with which to purchase unlocks/abilities. There is some platforming involved but puzzles are essentially limited to figuring out which superpower/suit is needed to remove an obstacle to progress. As such the gameplay is amusing in short bursts but tiresome over the long haul, especially if you’re 1) over the age of 10; and 2) playing by yourself.  The story is a slight but entertaining tale that begins with The Joker and various other Bat-villains robbing the guests at Gotham’s Man of the Year awards ceremony and segues into Lex Luthor recruiting The Joker to aid him in his bid to win the presidency of the United States. Batman and Robin eventually have to call Superman to help out, and eventually, with the Last Son of Krypton greatly weakened by exposure to Kryptonite, the JLA shows up to aid in the capture of the evil duo. (Interestingly, Superman is almost too powerful in this game, as he’s essentially invulnerable to harm and has abilities that the Dynamic Duo need four different suits to replicate.) The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and once you get past the major conceit that all of these characters are essentially self-aware toys, it’s pretty funny.  Once you’ve completed the story in LEGO Batman 2, you can take any currently-unlocked character and faff about in Gotham City, looking for imperiled citizens to rescue or miscreants to defeat. Although the game drops frequent hints about nearly every other aspect of gameplay, the method of actually unlocking characters remains somewhat obscure. Occasionally during a fight (for characters) or while wandering the cityscape and passing near an object (for vehicles), you will receive a button prompt and a message advising you that you can purchase that item for x number of studs. Once you do, that item is added to your roster/garage. In the course of your travels, you will discover items that can only be interacted with using the abilities of specific characters such as Poison Ivy, Man-Bat, or The Joker. However, actually obtaining those characters appears to be a surprisingly trial-and-error affair. Upon completion of the story, I had Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and a few assorted goons unlocked for a grand total of 12 out of 60 unlockable characters. (You can also replay any section of the story in “Free Play” mode (meaning with access to any unlocked character), but of course this approach suffers from the same shortcomings I mentioned above.)  The game looks and sounds great, but we come back to the fundamental problem of gameplay and the nature of LEGO games. These are games that are meant for kids and co-op. They are meant to be played several times, uncovering more bits and bobs on each playthrough. These are all concepts that are antithetical to the way that I play games. I don’t have kids or a gamer spouse and I rarely play through a game more than once. Kids don’t really mind repetition and doing the same thing ad nauseum; in fact, I’d venture to say psychologists probably have some term for a childhood phase during which they absolutely thrive on it. As an adult, I don’t normally bother with replays simply because if a game offers nothing new on a replay other than a different character, it doesn’t have enough novel content to justify spending my time.",-1,0,388

268750,Magicite,"Starting with positive, I like the controls they feel tight and responsive so far, I like the artstyle, and in general I actually really like the concept of this, Feels more like an arcade version of terreria.  BUT almost instantly, out of principle I have to give it a no just because the crafting is so annoying.  I didn't realize it would be so unintuitive. clunkily halving ingrediants then crafting 15 sword hilts or whatever because I don't know how to grab just 1 at a time and couldn't even if I wanted to because the inventory is stupidly small.  another game with unnecessary amounts of time researching recipes online as I play. Sure after a week or so I will probably get most of it down but the thing is It adds NOTHING to the game, it only takes away from it.  For a game that feels much like an arcadey platformer pop-in-for-a-half-hour-session type of game, I really don't understand what they were thinking with the crafting.   The game is at it's core a a relatively simple action/rpg arcade platformer style level based game. design the game as such IMO, it seems to have some identity issues going on.  add up resources like you do the gold, Have some sort of crafting menu that simply shows you what you can craft and what you need.  Simply click if you have the ingrediants.  wow was that so hard? probably would have saved me 3-4 hours of wiki'ing. and if someone were to argue 'well that's the fun, you need to be smart about your space and how to craft stuff' sorry but if 'inventory management' is a major part of this game, the devs did it wrong.  Magicite. A game that doesn't know what it wants to be.",-1,1,1899

I'm not kidding! I've also played against people five times my level, and most games I play have lopsided teams or AFK players.

Even though the premise is seedy in that you pamper (or not) or otherwise 'care' for your 'villagers' who are all criminals of varying degrees of severity, you can lose hours building and planning out new wings and sections.  Don't know when it was added, but the traits (deadly, stoic etc..) really add something to the game.  Touch of theme park, the sims and some Dwarf Fortress lite.

I played only for a few hours and already got bored of the 'fight enemies for 5 minutes and collect orbs for an hour'-policy. Not to mention the complexity of the actual combat... (none) If you like collecting orbs - get it. If you expect something alike God of War series(like I did) - this game will disappoint you.  Neat graphics, good music and nice environment.

307210,Will Fight for Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game of the Hour,"Is 84 minutes with a snack break thrown in worth $5?  WFfF reminds me of the flash games I used to play back in the early 2000's. As I remember them, they had a charming, if not minimalist art style, interesting or zany premises and usually did one or two things pretty well for what they were. I think that's a fair generalization of this game.  The game starts off as the player character, who is a professional wrestler, shows up drunk to work and is about to take a fall, giving up the championship belt to another wrestler. After a few clicks through the dialogue and it's now the future. The player character is homeless and goes around a city map bumping into his old friends/rivals from the glory days of wrestling in the WFF. Some are just as down on luck as the player character, others have become high ranking officials in the police department of even government. The player will then decide to talk or fight to solve these former wrestlers' problems.  Humor is a hard thing to capture in a game because humor is not universal. Something funny to someone can be an annoyance to the next. The humor in WFfF is zany and irreverent so I found myself smirking a couple times while playing the game. It's hit or miss but doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to be funny which is a good thing.   The humor serves the dialogue well and the highlight of the game is probably the dialogue system. In certain situations the player will have to convince characters to do things they may not want to do, a screen pops up displaying certain traits about the person the character is talking to and it's up to the player to decide how to tackle the situation. Adopting an agressive style, disagree with the character and do so in a snarky way and the person that needs the convincing may disapprove while assuming a different stance, agreeing with the person and being a little more to the point may be the required combination. It's definitely an interesting and organic way to handle dialogue and when it works, things go pretty smooth, when it doesn't work, I was forced to throw up my dukes and handle things through combat.  Combat is a little too simplistic for my liking, even in a game such as this. There are punches, kicks, and a shoulder charge with rapid pressing of these buttons stringing the attacks into a combo which changes the animation a little bit. My issues are the AI isn't that bright and the combat moves don't feel particularly wrestling-esque. AI will often close distance and get within melee range but since this game plays like an old beat 'em up, the characters can sometimes overlap on the x axis and instead of the computer trying to reposition itself, it will swing blindy over and over until the player moves the character around.  There's equipment in the game that changes stats such as damage and speed and the different stats do have a visible effect on how fast the character moves or the damage that they do but I only wish that there was a change to the appearance of the character too. I think it would be a little toucht hat goes a long way to show that the developer cared about the little things.  There's about 8 locations, a quest or two per map and one of those maps are unlocked once everything else has been solved. The graphics aren't that good with a lot of assets being reused and for some reason there are minigames of sorts that don't amount to anything and aren't very fun.  Oh I asked a question in the beginning and for me the answer is no. Those flash games were little time wasters that were occasionally fun but they were free and some of them were really well done with a bunch of little nuances throw in. Will Fight for Food has some good ideas but it doesn't seem much effort is put into the game to make those ideas shine.  ",-1,0,4713

277590,Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry,"Now, as a long term Assassin's Creed fan I was super god damn excited to play this game when I saw it on sale. However, when I finished it a day or so later, I felt a little disappointed.   This game overall feels more like a couple of long DLC missions in the main game than a stand alone game. It's entertaining enough if you liked Black Flag, because this is basically the same, but on a much smaller, less interesting scale. It feels like you're just playing as a reskinned Edward, as the idle animations are the exact same. You can hunt certain animals, but there's no purpose, because you can't craft or make more outfits. Like in Black Flag, you can plunder other ships, but the rewards are so badly scaled to the prices of the few upgrades, that you're basically decked out after you've pulverized four ships. Freedom Cry feels like someone cut a tiny square out of the bayeux tapestry. It's aesthetically pleasing in itself, but it's lacking a whole hell of a lot of context.   I personally don't feel like Freedom Cry's got enough content or weight to be its own game. I played it, I completed it, it was okay while it lasted, but in a critical light, this really isn't that big of a deal. I would't recommend buying this unless it's on sale.",-1,1,5633

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting.

For the most part its all about timing and not running out of health or energy. The puzzles are easy, and the fights arent hard, but add in a bit of fumbling to jump/move properly or position a block quickly/precisely and you run into annoyingly road-blocks/set-backs. Its not that its hard it just takes a couple more tries than would be entertaining.   I recommend and do not recommend this title. Its really 50/50",1,0,12175

270810,Jones On Fire," Jonas on Fire  it's a simple 2D side scrolling runner game where you have 2 buttons: jump and slide. It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. The player's mission is to guide a firefighter along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, the player will collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more. The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.  The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios. Graphically it's clearly based on  Minecraft  fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.   Jones of Fire  could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions,  Jones of Fire  doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.  I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.",-1,0,8239
233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679
233450,Prison Architect,"Fantastic game! very addicting. The game mechanics are well done, the gameplay is fun and entertaining. You can build your own prison from nothing to a massive 500 cell mega facility. You can do everything from scheduling classes to death row appeals. Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background. The game is also completely missing any sort of main menu when you first launch the game. I highly recommend this game and I rate it 4 out of 5.",1,0,13068

It might appeal to some, but I found the game to be fairly boring in nearly all areas. The dragons didn't seem very interesting or original, at least in my eyes, and were sometimes hard to control in the game itself. I found myelf getting shot from behind quite a lot, dying before I even knew what was happening. This could easily be attributed to my lack of skill in the game, but, ah, well, I really just found it hard not to get shot in the back.    One of the good points, I must add, is that the stats actually make a difference. I mean, some games get me confused as to why I need to up my stealth, or my stamina, or whatever else they can think up., but here it can be very clear as to the weaknesses and strengths of each dragon. That was nice, of course, but everything else sort of faded into the background. The art? I can barely remember it. The music? Was there any music at all in this game?   So, yeah, average game. Could just be my opinion, but I didn't like it. Play it if you want, but don't expect me to recommend it.",-1,1,9441

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative.

Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.

Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

271820,Card City Nights," Card City Nights is a true gem among the numerous games many indie studios release.   Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.  The deck building interface leaves some things to be desired, but is completely usable.   Card City Nights offers a fun challenge for both serious and casual gamers.  10/10",1,0,28028

268750,Magicite,"Firstly , Magicite is an amazing game with 9/10 graphics. But its very hard which adds challenge so it wont be like ' Hey , TAKE THIS WITH YOU ' or something like that. There are alot of gamers who dont like hard games. I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now. Or there could be a trade feature where players can trade OP , Non-OP weapons and armors through trade , and the comunity market.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575
233450,Prison Architect,Heartly recommend!!! Great simulation game with sufficient playability.,1,1,33593
233450,Prison Architect,"I adore this game, you should aswell, best prison simulator around. And far worth the price. I backed it on early access and watched it grow into the fine game it is today. The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

Nevertheless it's also a ton of fun and it will encourage you to find the best solution to deal with each monster, due to the possibilities of customization and the equipment at your disposal, which is quite remarkable.  Legend of Grimrock 2 is probably not a game for everyone, but if you are looking for something challenging then give it a shot.",1,0,40903

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,Awesome game. Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve because it lacks a proper ingame guide.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

213330,LEGO® Batman™ 2: DC Super Heroes,"LEGO Batman 2 is the first LEGO game that I’ve actually finished. Well, I may be slightly abusing the term “finished” here. My playthrough ended recently at 22.3%. So “abandoned” might be a more apt characterization, although in fairness to me, I did complete the story mode. I started playing the first game in this series and abandoned it fairly early on, probably due to the fact that the keyboard-and-mouse controls are abominable. Setting up a controller to play and actually playing with a controller are a breeze but do not–under any circumstances–attempt to play this game without one.  All of the LEGO games are built on a similar foundation: smashing enemies and collecting bricks/studs with which to purchase unlocks/abilities. There is some platforming involved but puzzles are essentially limited to figuring out which superpower/suit is needed to remove an obstacle to progress. As such the gameplay is amusing in short bursts but tiresome over the long haul, especially if you’re 1) over the age of 10; and 2) playing by yourself.  The story is a slight but entertaining tale that begins with The Joker and various other Bat-villains robbing the guests at Gotham’s Man of the Year awards ceremony and segues into Lex Luthor recruiting The Joker to aid him in his bid to win the presidency of the United States. Batman and Robin eventually have to call Superman to help out, and eventually, with the Last Son of Krypton greatly weakened by exposure to Kryptonite, the JLA shows up to aid in the capture of the evil duo. (Interestingly, Superman is almost too powerful in this game, as he’s essentially invulnerable to harm and has abilities that the Dynamic Duo need four different suits to replicate.) The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and once you get past the major conceit that all of these characters are essentially self-aware toys, it’s pretty funny.  Once you’ve completed the story in LEGO Batman 2, you can take any currently-unlocked character and faff about in Gotham City, looking for imperiled citizens to rescue or miscreants to defeat. Although the game drops frequent hints about nearly every other aspect of gameplay, the method of actually unlocking characters remains somewhat obscure. Occasionally during a fight (for characters) or while wandering the cityscape and passing near an object (for vehicles), you will receive a button prompt and a message advising you that you can purchase that item for x number of studs. Once you do, that item is added to your roster/garage. In the course of your travels, you will discover items that can only be interacted with using the abilities of specific characters such as Poison Ivy, Man-Bat, or The Joker. However, actually obtaining those characters appears to be a surprisingly trial-and-error affair. Upon completion of the story, I had Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and a few assorted goons unlocked for a grand total of 12 out of 60 unlockable characters. (You can also replay any section of the story in “Free Play” mode (meaning with access to any unlocked character), but of course this approach suffers from the same shortcomings I mentioned above.)  The game looks and sounds great, but we come back to the fundamental problem of gameplay and the nature of LEGO games. These are games that are meant for kids and co-op. They are meant to be played several times, uncovering more bits and bobs on each playthrough. These are all concepts that are antithetical to the way that I play games. I don’t have kids or a gamer spouse and I rarely play through a game more than once. Kids don’t really mind repetition and doing the same thing ad nauseum; in fact, I’d venture to say psychologists probably have some term for a childhood phase during which they absolutely thrive on it. As an adult, I don’t normally bother with replays simply because if a game offers nothing new on a replay other than a different character, it doesn’t have enough novel content to justify spending my time.",-1,0,388

268750,Magicite,"Starting with positive, I like the controls they feel tight and responsive so far, I like the artstyle, and in general I actually really like the concept of this, Feels more like an arcade version of terreria.  BUT almost instantly, out of principle I have to give it a no just because the crafting is so annoying.  I didn't realize it would be so unintuitive. clunkily halving ingrediants then crafting 15 sword hilts or whatever because I don't know how to grab just 1 at a time and couldn't even if I wanted to because the inventory is stupidly small.  another game with unnecessary amounts of time researching recipes online as I play. Sure after a week or so I will probably get most of it down but the thing is It adds NOTHING to the game, it only takes away from it.  For a game that feels much like an arcadey platformer pop-in-for-a-half-hour-session type of game, I really don't understand what they were thinking with the crafting.   The game is at it's core a a relatively simple action/rpg arcade platformer style level based game. design the game as such IMO, it seems to have some identity issues going on.  add up resources like you do the gold, Have some sort of crafting menu that simply shows you what you can craft and what you need.  Simply click if you have the ingrediants.  wow was that so hard? probably would have saved me 3-4 hours of wiki'ing. and if someone were to argue 'well that's the fun, you need to be smart about your space and how to craft stuff' sorry but if 'inventory management' is a major part of this game, the devs did it wrong.

307210,Will Fight for Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game of the Hour,"Is 84 minutes with a snack break thrown in worth $5?  WFfF reminds me of the flash games I used to play back in the early 2000's. As I remember them, they had a charming, if not minimalist art style, interesting or zany premises and usually did one or two things pretty well for what they were. I think that's a fair generalization of this game.  The game starts off as the player character, who is a professional wrestler, shows up drunk to work and is about to take a fall, giving up the championship belt to another wrestler. After a few clicks through the dialogue and it's now the future. The player character is homeless and goes around a city map bumping into his old friends/rivals from the glory days of wrestling in the WFF. Some are just as down on luck as the player character, others have become high ranking officials in the police department of even government. The player will then decide to talk or fight to solve these former wrestlers' problems.  Humor is a hard thing to capture in a game because humor is not universal. Something funny to someone can be an annoyance to the next. The humor in WFfF is zany and irreverent so I found myself smirking a couple times while playing the game. It's hit or miss but doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to be funny which is a good thing.   The humor serves the dialogue well and the highlight of the game is probably the dialogue system. In certain situations the player will have to convince characters to do things they may not want to do, a screen pops up displaying certain traits about the person the character is talking to and it's up to the player to decide how to tackle the situation. Adopting an agressive style, disagree with the character and do so in a snarky way and the person that needs the convincing may disapprove while assuming a different stance, agreeing with the person and being a little more to the point may be the required combination. It's definitely an interesting and organic way to handle dialogue and when it works, things go pretty smooth, when it doesn't work, I was forced to throw up my dukes and handle things through combat.  Combat is a little too simplistic for my liking, even in a game such as this. There are punches, kicks, and a shoulder charge with rapid pressing of these buttons stringing the attacks into a combo which changes the animation a little bit. My issues are the AI isn't that bright and the combat moves don't feel particularly wrestling-esque. AI will often close distance and get within melee range but since this game plays like an old beat 'em up, the characters can sometimes overlap on the x axis and instead of the computer trying to reposition itself, it will swing blindy over and over until the player moves the character around.  There's equipment in the game that changes stats such as damage and speed and the different stats do have a visible effect on how fast the character moves or the damage that they do but I only wish that there was a change to the appearance of the character too. I think it would be a little toucht hat goes a long way to show that the developer cared about the little things.  There's about 8 locations, a quest or two per map and one of those maps are unlocked once everything else has been solved. The graphics aren't that good with a lot of assets being reused and for some reason there are minigames of sorts that don't amount to anything and aren't very fun.  Oh I asked a question in the beginning and for me the answer is no. Those flash games were little time wasters that were occasionally fun but they were free and some of them were really well done with a bunch of little nuances throw in. Will Fight for Food has some good ideas but it doesn't seem much effort is put into the game to make those ideas shine.  ",-1,0,4713

277590,Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry,"Now, as a long term Assassin's Creed fan I was super god damn excited to play this game when I saw it on sale. However, when I finished it a day or so later, I felt a little disappointed.   This game overall feels more like a couple of long DLC missions in the main game than a stand alone game. It's entertaining enough if you liked Black Flag, because this is basically the same, but on a much smaller, less interesting scale. It feels like you're just playing as a reskinned Edward, as the idle animations are the exact same. You can hunt certain animals, but there's no purpose, because you can't craft or make more outfits. Like in Black Flag, you can plunder other ships, but the rewards are so badly scaled to the prices of the few upgrades, that you're basically decked out after you've pulverized four ships. Freedom Cry feels like someone cut a tiny square out of the bayeux tapestry. It's aesthetically pleasing in itself, but it's lacking a whole hell of a lot of context.   I personally don't feel like Freedom Cry's got enough content or weight to be its own game. I played it, I completed it, it was okay while it lasted, but in a critical light, this really isn't that big of a deal. I would't recommend buying this unless it's on sale.",-1,1,5633

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.

202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting.

270810,Jones On Fire," Jonas on Fire  it's a simple 2D side scrolling runner game where you have 2 buttons: jump and slide. It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. The player's mission is to guide a firefighter along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, the player will collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more. The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.  The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios. Graphically it's clearly based on  Minecraft  fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.   Jones of Fire  could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions,  Jones of Fire  doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.  I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.",-1,0,8239
35700,Trine,"This is your Classic side scroller. You fight baddies, solve simple/moderatly difficult puzzles, and defeat occational bosses. For the most part its all about timing and not running out of health or energy. The puzzles are easy, and the fights arent hard, but add in a bit of fumbling to jump/move properly or position a block quickly/precisely and you run into annoyingly road-blocks/set-backs. Its not that its hard it just takes a couple more tries than would be entertaining.   I recommend and do not recommend this title. Its really 50/50",1,0,12175

233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679

Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background.

353130,Time of Dragons,"This game...meh. I didn't really get into it. Not my style, you could say, but all things considered, I really just didn't like it. It might appeal to some, but I found the game to be fairly boring in nearly all areas. The dragons didn't seem very interesting or original, at least in my eyes, and were sometimes hard to control in the game itself. I found myelf getting shot from behind quite a lot, dying before I even knew what was happening. This could easily be attributed to my lack of skill in the game, but, ah, well, I really just found it hard not to get shot in the back.    One of the good points, I must add, is that the stats actually make a difference. I mean, some games get me confused as to why I need to up my stealth, or my stamina, or whatever else they can think up., but here it can be very clear as to the weaknesses and strengths of each dragon. That was nice, of course, but everything else sort of faded into the background. The art? I can barely remember it. The music? Was there any music at all in this game?   So, yeah, average game. Could just be my opinion, but I didn't like it. Play it if you want, but don't expect me to recommend it.",-1,1,9441

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative.

Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.

Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

271820,Card City Nights," Card City Nights is a true gem among the numerous games many indie studios release.   Pros: Gameplay, Art, Music, Controls, Updates, Value Cons:  None , Deck Building Interface  Card City Nights is simple to learn yet allows for a number of viable strategies. TCG veterans and casual players alike will enjoy the variety of playstyles and opponents: aggro, control, balanced, and more. Cartoony yet charming, the artwork and music fit stupendously. Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.  The deck building interface leaves some things to be desired, but is completely usable.   Card City Nights offers a fun challenge for both serious and casual gamers.  10/10",1,0,28028

There are alot of gamers who dont like hard games. I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now. Or there could be a trade feature where players can trade OP , Non-OP weapons and armors through trade , and the comunity market.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575

233450,Prison Architect,"I adore this game, you should aswell, best prison simulator around. And far worth the price. I backed it on early access and watched it grow into the fine game it is today. The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect, Early Access Review,1,0,44437
233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,Awesome game. Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve because it lacks a proper ingame guide. There is a tutorial that explains the basic and together with some tips &amp; guides from the internet you will work it.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a great sandbox game that gives a lot of room and possibilities for one's own creativity and to go full nerd-mod. Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play. There is a great development team behind the game and an even greater community that amazes again and again with their own creations and helping side. Even not being totally finished (last update planned for august 2016) it was all the way and will always be an enjoyable game.",1,0,46985

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

213330,LEGO® Batman™ 2: DC Super Heroes,"LEGO Batman 2 is the first LEGO game that I’ve actually finished. Well, I may be slightly abusing the term “finished” here. My playthrough ended recently at 22.3%. So “abandoned” might be a more apt characterization, although in fairness to me, I did complete the story mode. I started playing the first game in this series and abandoned it fairly early on, probably due to the fact that the keyboard-and-mouse controls are abominable. Setting up a controller to play and actually playing with a controller are a breeze but do not–under any circumstances–attempt to play this game without one.  All of the LEGO games are built on a similar foundation: smashing enemies and collecting bricks/studs with which to purchase unlocks/abilities. There is some platforming involved but puzzles are essentially limited to figuring out which superpower/suit is needed to remove an obstacle to progress. As such the gameplay is amusing in short bursts but tiresome over the long haul, especially if you’re 1) over the age of 10; and 2) playing by yourself.  The story is a slight but entertaining tale that begins with The Joker and various other Bat-villains robbing the guests at Gotham’s Man of the Year awards ceremony and segues into Lex Luthor recruiting The Joker to aid him in his bid to win the presidency of the United States. Batman and Robin eventually have to call Superman to help out, and eventually, with the Last Son of Krypton greatly weakened by exposure to Kryptonite, the JLA shows up to aid in the capture of the evil duo. (Interestingly, Superman is almost too powerful in this game, as he’s essentially invulnerable to harm and has abilities that the Dynamic Duo need four different suits to replicate.) The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and once you get past the major conceit that all of these characters are essentially self-aware toys, it’s pretty funny.  Once you’ve completed the story in LEGO Batman 2, you can take any currently-unlocked character and faff about in Gotham City, looking for imperiled citizens to rescue or miscreants to defeat. Although the game drops frequent hints about nearly every other aspect of gameplay, the method of actually unlocking characters remains somewhat obscure. Occasionally during a fight (for characters) or while wandering the cityscape and passing near an object (for vehicles), you will receive a button prompt and a message advising you that you can purchase that item for x number of studs. Once you do, that item is added to your roster/garage. In the course of your travels, you will discover items that can only be interacted with using the abilities of specific characters such as Poison Ivy, Man-Bat, or The Joker. However, actually obtaining those characters appears to be a surprisingly trial-and-error affair. Upon completion of the story, I had Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and a few assorted goons unlocked for a grand total of 12 out of 60 unlockable characters. (You can also replay any section of the story in “Free Play” mode (meaning with access to any unlocked character), but of course this approach suffers from the same shortcomings I mentioned above.)  The game looks and sounds great, but we come back to the fundamental problem of gameplay and the nature of LEGO games. These are games that are meant for kids and co-op. They are meant to be played several times, uncovering more bits and bobs on each playthrough. These are all concepts that are antithetical to the way that I play games. I don’t have kids or a gamer spouse and I rarely play through a game more than once. Kids don’t really mind repetition and doing the same thing ad nauseum; in fact, I’d venture to say psychologists probably have some term for a childhood phase during which they absolutely thrive on it. As an adult, I don’t normally bother with replays simply because if a game offers nothing new on a replay other than a different character, it doesn’t have enough novel content to justify spending my time.",-1,0,388

268750,Magicite,"Starting with positive, I like the controls they feel tight and responsive so far, I like the artstyle, and in general I actually really like the concept of this, Feels more like an arcade version of terreria.  BUT almost instantly, out of principle I have to give it a no just because the crafting is so annoying.  I didn't realize it would be so unintuitive. clunkily halving ingrediants then crafting 15 sword hilts or whatever because I don't know how to grab just 1 at a time and couldn't even if I wanted to because the inventory is stupidly small.  another game with unnecessary amounts of time researching recipes online as I play. Sure after a week or so I will probably get most of it down but the thing is It adds NOTHING to the game, it only takes away from it.  For a game that feels much like an arcadey platformer pop-in-for-a-half-hour-session type of game, I really don't understand what they were thinking with the crafting.   The game is at it's core a a relatively simple action/rpg arcade platformer style level based game. design the game as such IMO, it seems to have some identity issues going on.  add up resources like you do the gold, Have some sort of crafting menu that simply shows you what you can craft and what you need.  Simply click if you have the ingrediants.  wow was that so hard? probably would have saved me 3-4 hours of wiki'ing. and if someone were to argue 'well that's the fun, you need to be smart about your space and how to craft stuff' sorry but if 'inventory management' is a major part of this game, the devs did it wrong.

307210,Will Fight for Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game of the Hour,"Is 84 minutes with a snack break thrown in worth $5?  WFfF reminds me of the flash games I used to play back in the early 2000's. As I remember them, they had a charming, if not minimalist art style, interesting or zany premises and usually did one or two things pretty well for what they were. I think that's a fair generalization of this game.  The game starts off as the player character, who is a professional wrestler, shows up drunk to work and is about to take a fall, giving up the championship belt to another wrestler. After a few clicks through the dialogue and it's now the future. The player character is homeless and goes around a city map bumping into his old friends/rivals from the glory days of wrestling in the WFF. Some are just as down on luck as the player character, others have become high ranking officials in the police department of even government. The player will then decide to talk or fight to solve these former wrestlers' problems.  Humor is a hard thing to capture in a game because humor is not universal. Something funny to someone can be an annoyance to the next. The humor in WFfF is zany and irreverent so I found myself smirking a couple times while playing the game. It's hit or miss but doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to be funny which is a good thing.   The humor serves the dialogue well and the highlight of the game is probably the dialogue system. In certain situations the player will have to convince characters to do things they may not want to do, a screen pops up displaying certain traits about the person the character is talking to and it's up to the player to decide how to tackle the situation. Adopting an agressive style, disagree with the character and do so in a snarky way and the person that needs the convincing may disapprove while assuming a different stance, agreeing with the person and being a little more to the point may be the required combination. It's definitely an interesting and organic way to handle dialogue and when it works, things go pretty smooth, when it doesn't work, I was forced to throw up my dukes and handle things through combat.  Combat is a little too simplistic for my liking, even in a game such as this. There are punches, kicks, and a shoulder charge with rapid pressing of these buttons stringing the attacks into a combo which changes the animation a little bit. My issues are the AI isn't that bright and the combat moves don't feel particularly wrestling-esque. AI will often close distance and get within melee range but since this game plays like an old beat 'em up, the characters can sometimes overlap on the x axis and instead of the computer trying to reposition itself, it will swing blindy over and over until the player moves the character around.  There's equipment in the game that changes stats such as damage and speed and the different stats do have a visible effect on how fast the character moves or the damage that they do but I only wish that there was a change to the appearance of the character too. I think it would be a little toucht hat goes a long way to show that the developer cared about the little things.  There's about 8 locations, a quest or two per map and one of those maps are unlocked once everything else has been solved. The graphics aren't that good with a lot of assets being reused and for some reason there are minigames of sorts that don't amount to anything and aren't very fun.  Oh I asked a question in the beginning and for me the answer is no. Those flash games were little time wasters that were occasionally fun but they were free and some of them were really well done with a bunch of little nuances throw in. Will Fight for Food has some good ideas but it doesn't seem much effort is put into the game to make those ideas shine.  ",-1,0,4713

277590,Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry,"Now, as a long term Assassin's Creed fan I was super god damn excited to play this game when I saw it on sale. However, when I finished it a day or so later, I felt a little disappointed.   This game overall feels more like a couple of long DLC missions in the main game than a stand alone game. It's entertaining enough if you liked Black Flag, because this is basically the same, but on a much smaller, less interesting scale. It feels like you're just playing as a reskinned Edward, as the idle animations are the exact same. You can hunt certain animals, but there's no purpose, because you can't craft or make more outfits. Like in Black Flag, you can plunder other ships, but the rewards are so badly scaled to the prices of the few upgrades, that you're basically decked out after you've pulverized four ships. Freedom Cry feels like someone cut a tiny square out of the bayeux tapestry. It's aesthetically pleasing in itself, but it's lacking a whole hell of a lot of context.   I personally don't feel like Freedom Cry's got enough content or weight to be its own game. I played it, I completed it, it was okay while it lasted, but in a critical light, this really isn't that big of a deal. I would't recommend buying this unless it's on sale.",-1,1,5633

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.

Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.

270810,Jones On Fire," Jonas on Fire  it's a simple 2D side scrolling runner game where you have 2 buttons: jump and slide. It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. The player's mission is to guide a firefighter along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, the player will collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more. The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.  The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios. Graphically it's clearly based on  Minecraft  fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.   Jones of Fire  could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions,  Jones of Fire  doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.  I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.",-1,0,8239

It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679

You can build your own prison from nothing to a massive 500 cell mega facility. You can do everything from scheduling classes to death row appeals. Your prison is only held back by your imagination with highly customizable environments. Only thing I see missing is a soundtrack or some kind of music for the background.

It might appeal to some, but I found the game to be fairly boring in nearly all areas. The dragons didn't seem very interesting or original, at least in my eyes, and were sometimes hard to control in the game itself. I found myelf getting shot from behind quite a lot, dying before I even knew what was happening. This could easily be attributed to my lack of skill in the game, but, ah, well, I really just found it hard not to get shot in the back.    One of the good points, I must add, is that the stats actually make a difference. I mean, some games get me confused as to why I need to up my stealth, or my stamina, or whatever else they can think up., but here it can be very clear as to the weaknesses and strengths of each dragon. That was nice, of course, but everything else sort of faded into the background. The art? I can barely remember it. The music? Was there any music at all in this game?   So, yeah, average game. Could just be my opinion, but I didn't like it. Play it if you want, but don't expect me to recommend it.",-1,1,9441

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative. Prison Architect is extremely addicting for me, it's challenging and it is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.",1,0,19156

Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

Control with the mouse is clean and easy. Finally, developers have updated the game several times to add more content, for free.

268750,Magicite,"A fun and addicting rogue-like|lite style game. The mechanics are easy to grasp and can be picked up in a few hours.   My only complaint is that you can't craft without bringing up the main inventory window, which can be dicey in later stages. It would have been nice for that particular menu to only occupy part of the window so you could tell if something gigantic and nasty was going to murder you.",1,0,29855

268750,Magicite,"Firstly , Magicite is an amazing game with 9/10 graphics. But its very hard which adds challenge so it wont be like ' Hey , TAKE THIS WITH YOU ' or something like that. There are alot of gamers who dont like hard games. I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now. Or there could be a trade feature where players can trade OP , Non-OP weapons and armors through trade , and the comunity market. Overall the game is great with lots of challenge and fun many gamers thrive on.",1,0,32198

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575
233450,Prison Architect,Heartly recommend!!! Great simulation game with sufficient playability.,1,1,33593
233450,Prison Architect,"I adore this game, you should aswell, best prison simulator around. And far worth the price. I backed it on early access and watched it grow into the fine game it is today. The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,Awesome game. Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve because it lacks a proper ingame guide.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play.

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

213330,LEGO® Batman™ 2: DC Super Heroes,"LEGO Batman 2 is the first LEGO game that I’ve actually finished. Well, I may be slightly abusing the term “finished” here. My playthrough ended recently at 22.3%. So “abandoned” might be a more apt characterization, although in fairness to me, I did complete the story mode. I started playing the first game in this series and abandoned it fairly early on, probably due to the fact that the keyboard-and-mouse controls are abominable. Setting up a controller to play and actually playing with a controller are a breeze but do not–under any circumstances–attempt to play this game without one.  All of the LEGO games are built on a similar foundation: smashing enemies and collecting bricks/studs with which to purchase unlocks/abilities. There is some platforming involved but puzzles are essentially limited to figuring out which superpower/suit is needed to remove an obstacle to progress. As such the gameplay is amusing in short bursts but tiresome over the long haul, especially if you’re 1) over the age of 10; and 2) playing by yourself.  The story is a slight but entertaining tale that begins with The Joker and various other Bat-villains robbing the guests at Gotham’s Man of the Year awards ceremony and segues into Lex Luthor recruiting The Joker to aid him in his bid to win the presidency of the United States. Batman and Robin eventually have to call Superman to help out, and eventually, with the Last Son of Krypton greatly weakened by exposure to Kryptonite, the JLA shows up to aid in the capture of the evil duo. (Interestingly, Superman is almost too powerful in this game, as he’s essentially invulnerable to harm and has abilities that the Dynamic Duo need four different suits to replicate.) The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and once you get past the major conceit that all of these characters are essentially self-aware toys, it’s pretty funny.  Once you’ve completed the story in LEGO Batman 2, you can take any currently-unlocked character and faff about in Gotham City, looking for imperiled citizens to rescue or miscreants to defeat. Although the game drops frequent hints about nearly every other aspect of gameplay, the method of actually unlocking characters remains somewhat obscure. Occasionally during a fight (for characters) or while wandering the cityscape and passing near an object (for vehicles), you will receive a button prompt and a message advising you that you can purchase that item for x number of studs. Once you do, that item is added to your roster/garage. In the course of your travels, you will discover items that can only be interacted with using the abilities of specific characters such as Poison Ivy, Man-Bat, or The Joker. However, actually obtaining those characters appears to be a surprisingly trial-and-error affair. Upon completion of the story, I had Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and a few assorted goons unlocked for a grand total of 12 out of 60 unlockable characters. (You can also replay any section of the story in “Free Play” mode (meaning with access to any unlocked character), but of course this approach suffers from the same shortcomings I mentioned above.)  The game looks and sounds great, but we come back to the fundamental problem of gameplay and the nature of LEGO games. These are games that are meant for kids and co-op. They are meant to be played several times, uncovering more bits and bobs on each playthrough. These are all concepts that are antithetical to the way that I play games. I don’t have kids or a gamer spouse and I rarely play through a game more than once. Kids don’t really mind repetition and doing the same thing ad nauseum; in fact, I’d venture to say psychologists probably have some term for a childhood phase during which they absolutely thrive on it. As an adult, I don’t normally bother with replays simply because if a game offers nothing new on a replay other than a different character, it doesn’t have enough novel content to justify spending my time.",-1,0,388

BUT almost instantly, out of principle I have to give it a no just because the crafting is so annoying.  I didn't realize it would be so unintuitive. clunkily halving ingrediants then crafting 15 sword hilts or whatever because I don't know how to grab just 1 at a time and couldn't even if I wanted to because the inventory is stupidly small.  another game with unnecessary amounts of time researching recipes online as I play. Sure after a week or so I will probably get most of it down but the thing is It adds NOTHING to the game, it only takes away from it.  For a game that feels much like an arcadey platformer pop-in-for-a-half-hour-session type of game, I really don't understand what they were thinking with the crafting.   The game is at it's core a a relatively simple action/rpg arcade platformer style level based game. design the game as such IMO, it seems to have some identity issues going on.  add up resources like you do the gold, Have some sort of crafting menu that simply shows you what you can craft and what you need.  Simply click if you have the ingrediants.  wow was that so hard? probably would have saved me 3-4 hours of wiki'ing. and if someone were to argue 'well that's the fun, you need to be smart about your space and how to craft stuff' sorry but if 'inventory management' is a major part of this game, the devs did it wrong.

233450,Prison Architect,"Perhaps a little on the easy side. There's a compelling theme of controlling the lives, environment and regime of inmates. Control freaks will love this game.  Even though the premise is seedy in that you pamper (or not) or otherwise 'care' for your 'villagers' who are all criminals of varying degrees of severity, you can lose hours building and planning out new wings and sections.  Don't know when it was added, but the traits (deadly, stoic etc..) really add something to the game.  Touch of theme park, the sims and some Dwarf Fortress lite.  A great  Early Access  game that I recommend.",1,1,4108

Thus my 'review' is based on 'what I thought it would be and what it turned out to be', not on 'how well does fit into the series'.  I played only for a few hours and already got bored of the 'fight enemies for 5 minutes and collect orbs for an hour'-policy. Not to mention the complexity of the actual combat... (none) If you like collecting orbs - get it. If you expect something alike God of War series(like I did) - this game will disappoint you.  Neat graphics, good music and nice environment.

307210,Will Fight for Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game of the Hour,"Is 84 minutes with a snack break thrown in worth $5?  WFfF reminds me of the flash games I used to play back in the early 2000's. As I remember them, they had a charming, if not minimalist art style, interesting or zany premises and usually did one or two things pretty well for what they were. I think that's a fair generalization of this game.  The game starts off as the player character, who is a professional wrestler, shows up drunk to work and is about to take a fall, giving up the championship belt to another wrestler. After a few clicks through the dialogue and it's now the future. The player character is homeless and goes around a city map bumping into his old friends/rivals from the glory days of wrestling in the WFF. Some are just as down on luck as the player character, others have become high ranking officials in the police department of even government. The player will then decide to talk or fight to solve these former wrestlers' problems.  Humor is a hard thing to capture in a game because humor is not universal. Something funny to someone can be an annoyance to the next. The humor in WFfF is zany and irreverent so I found myself smirking a couple times while playing the game. It's hit or miss but doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to be funny which is a good thing.   The humor serves the dialogue well and the highlight of the game is probably the dialogue system. In certain situations the player will have to convince characters to do things they may not want to do, a screen pops up displaying certain traits about the person the character is talking to and it's up to the player to decide how to tackle the situation. Adopting an agressive style, disagree with the character and do so in a snarky way and the person that needs the convincing may disapprove while assuming a different stance, agreeing with the person and being a little more to the point may be the required combination. It's definitely an interesting and organic way to handle dialogue and when it works, things go pretty smooth, when it doesn't work, I was forced to throw up my dukes and handle things through combat.  Combat is a little too simplistic for my liking, even in a game such as this. There are punches, kicks, and a shoulder charge with rapid pressing of these buttons stringing the attacks into a combo which changes the animation a little bit. My issues are the AI isn't that bright and the combat moves don't feel particularly wrestling-esque. AI will often close distance and get within melee range but since this game plays like an old beat 'em up, the characters can sometimes overlap on the x axis and instead of the computer trying to reposition itself, it will swing blindy over and over until the player moves the character around.  There's equipment in the game that changes stats such as damage and speed and the different stats do have a visible effect on how fast the character moves or the damage that they do but I only wish that there was a change to the appearance of the character too. I think it would be a little toucht hat goes a long way to show that the developer cared about the little things.  There's about 8 locations, a quest or two per map and one of those maps are unlocked once everything else has been solved. The graphics aren't that good with a lot of assets being reused and for some reason there are minigames of sorts that don't amount to anything and aren't very fun.  Oh I asked a question in the beginning and for me the answer is no. Those flash games were little time wasters that were occasionally fun but they were free and some of them were really well done with a bunch of little nuances throw in. Will Fight for Food has some good ideas but it doesn't seem much effort is put into the game to make those ideas shine.  ",-1,0,4713

277590,Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry,"Now, as a long term Assassin's Creed fan I was super god damn excited to play this game when I saw it on sale. However, when I finished it a day or so later, I felt a little disappointed.   This game overall feels more like a couple of long DLC missions in the main game than a stand alone game. It's entertaining enough if you liked Black Flag, because this is basically the same, but on a much smaller, less interesting scale. It feels like you're just playing as a reskinned Edward, as the idle animations are the exact same. You can hunt certain animals, but there's no purpose, because you can't craft or make more outfits. Like in Black Flag, you can plunder other ships, but the rewards are so badly scaled to the prices of the few upgrades, that you're basically decked out after you've pulverized four ships. Freedom Cry feels like someone cut a tiny square out of the bayeux tapestry. It's aesthetically pleasing in itself, but it's lacking a whole hell of a lot of context.   I personally don't feel like Freedom Cry's got enough content or weight to be its own game. I played it, I completed it, it was okay while it lasted, but in a critical light, this really isn't that big of a deal. I would't recommend buying this unless it's on sale.",-1,1,5633

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

For me this goes on the shelf, at least until the controls are fixed, hopefully they have somone on the staff play the original, and possibly get a coder that isn't hell-bent on that hideous config.

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.

Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting.

270810,Jones On Fire," Jonas on Fire  it's a simple 2D side scrolling runner game where you have 2 buttons: jump and slide. It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. The player's mission is to guide a firefighter along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, the player will collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more. The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.  The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios. Graphically it's clearly based on  Minecraft  fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.   Jones of Fire  could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions,  Jones of Fire  doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.  I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.",-1,0,8239
233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679

It might appeal to some, but I found the game to be fairly boring in nearly all areas. The dragons didn't seem very interesting or original, at least in my eyes, and were sometimes hard to control in the game itself. I found myelf getting shot from behind quite a lot, dying before I even knew what was happening. This could easily be attributed to my lack of skill in the game, but, ah, well, I really just found it hard not to get shot in the back.    One of the good points, I must add, is that the stats actually make a difference. I mean, some games get me confused as to why I need to up my stealth, or my stamina, or whatever else they can think up., but here it can be very clear as to the weaknesses and strengths of each dragon. That was nice, of course, but everything else sort of faded into the background. The art? I can barely remember it. The music? Was there any music at all in this game?   So, yeah, average game. Could just be my opinion, but I didn't like it. Play it if you want, but don't expect me to recommend it.",-1,1,9441

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative. Prison Architect is extremely addicting for me, it's challenging and it is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.",1,0,19156

233450,Prison Architect,"This game is amazingly addicting and way to much controlling every minute of prisoners lives. It should not be this fun. Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

233450,Prison Architect,"Had this game from the begining and let me just say it has become THE benchmark when it comes to this type of game. Nobody does it better, nobody may ever do it better! So buy the god damn thing right now!!",1,0,31544
233450,Prison Architect,I just love this game. Its really good and Its not bad.  Everything in my prison is going great. I love every part of it.      Except for those 4 prisoners that tunneled their way out.,1,0,32089
268750,Magicite,"Firstly , Magicite is an amazing game with 9/10 graphics. But its very hard which adds challenge so it wont be like ' Hey , TAKE THIS WITH YOU ' or something like that. There are alot of gamers who dont like hard games. I was thinking that there could be a mode between ' Easy ' or ' Hard ' where Easy you only lose coins + levels + exp , where hard mode is basically the magicite we all know now. Or there could be a trade feature where players can trade OP , Non-OP weapons and armors through trade , and the comunity market. Overall the game is great with lots of challenge and fun many gamers thrive on.",1,0,32198

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Love the game!!!  this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.  You move U D L R with W A S D and you rotate with Q, E (default) and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.  Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.  Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575
233450,Prison Architect,Heartly recommend!!! Great simulation game with sufficient playability.,1,1,33593
233450,Prison Architect,"I adore this game, you should aswell, best prison simulator around. And far worth the price. I backed it on early access and watched it grow into the fine game it is today. The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,Awesome game. Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve because it lacks a proper ingame guide.

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play. There is a great development team behind the game and an even greater community that amazes again and again with their own creations and helping side.

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740

213330,LEGO® Batman™ 2: DC Super Heroes,"LEGO Batman 2 is the first LEGO game that I’ve actually finished. Well, I may be slightly abusing the term “finished” here. My playthrough ended recently at 22.3%. So “abandoned” might be a more apt characterization, although in fairness to me, I did complete the story mode. I started playing the first game in this series and abandoned it fairly early on, probably due to the fact that the keyboard-and-mouse controls are abominable. Setting up a controller to play and actually playing with a controller are a breeze but do not–under any circumstances–attempt to play this game without one.  All of the LEGO games are built on a similar foundation: smashing enemies and collecting bricks/studs with which to purchase unlocks/abilities. There is some platforming involved but puzzles are essentially limited to figuring out which superpower/suit is needed to remove an obstacle to progress. As such the gameplay is amusing in short bursts but tiresome over the long haul, especially if you’re 1) over the age of 10; and 2) playing by yourself.  The story is a slight but entertaining tale that begins with The Joker and various other Bat-villains robbing the guests at Gotham’s Man of the Year awards ceremony and segues into Lex Luthor recruiting The Joker to aid him in his bid to win the presidency of the United States. Batman and Robin eventually have to call Superman to help out, and eventually, with the Last Son of Krypton greatly weakened by exposure to Kryptonite, the JLA shows up to aid in the capture of the evil duo. (Interestingly, Superman is almost too powerful in this game, as he’s essentially invulnerable to harm and has abilities that the Dynamic Duo need four different suits to replicate.) The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and once you get past the major conceit that all of these characters are essentially self-aware toys, it’s pretty funny.  Once you’ve completed the story in LEGO Batman 2, you can take any currently-unlocked character and faff about in Gotham City, looking for imperiled citizens to rescue or miscreants to defeat. Although the game drops frequent hints about nearly every other aspect of gameplay, the method of actually unlocking characters remains somewhat obscure. Occasionally during a fight (for characters) or while wandering the cityscape and passing near an object (for vehicles), you will receive a button prompt and a message advising you that you can purchase that item for x number of studs. Once you do, that item is added to your roster/garage. In the course of your travels, you will discover items that can only be interacted with using the abilities of specific characters such as Poison Ivy, Man-Bat, or The Joker. However, actually obtaining those characters appears to be a surprisingly trial-and-error affair. Upon completion of the story, I had Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and a few assorted goons unlocked for a grand total of 12 out of 60 unlockable characters. (You can also replay any section of the story in “Free Play” mode (meaning with access to any unlocked character), but of course this approach suffers from the same shortcomings I mentioned above.)  The game looks and sounds great, but we come back to the fundamental problem of gameplay and the nature of LEGO games. These are games that are meant for kids and co-op. They are meant to be played several times, uncovering more bits and bobs on each playthrough. These are all concepts that are antithetical to the way that I play games. I don’t have kids or a gamer spouse and I rarely play through a game more than once. Kids don’t really mind repetition and doing the same thing ad nauseum; in fact, I’d venture to say psychologists probably have some term for a childhood phase during which they absolutely thrive on it. As an adult, I don’t normally bother with replays simply because if a game offers nothing new on a replay other than a different character, it doesn’t have enough novel content to justify spending my time.",-1,0,388

BUT almost instantly, out of principle I have to give it a no just because the crafting is so annoying.  I didn't realize it would be so unintuitive. clunkily halving ingrediants then crafting 15 sword hilts or whatever because I don't know how to grab just 1 at a time and couldn't even if I wanted to because the inventory is stupidly small.  another game with unnecessary amounts of time researching recipes online as I play. Sure after a week or so I will probably get most of it down but the thing is It adds NOTHING to the game, it only takes away from it.  For a game that feels much like an arcadey platformer pop-in-for-a-half-hour-session type of game, I really don't understand what they were thinking with the crafting.   The game is at it's core a a relatively simple action/rpg arcade platformer style level based game. design the game as such IMO, it seems to have some identity issues going on.  add up resources like you do the gold, Have some sort of crafting menu that simply shows you what you can craft and what you need.  Simply click if you have the ingrediants.  wow was that so hard? probably would have saved me 3-4 hours of wiki'ing. and if someone were to argue 'well that's the fun, you need to be smart about your space and how to craft stuff' sorry but if 'inventory management' is a major part of this game, the devs did it wrong.

307210,Will Fight for Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game of the Hour,"Is 84 minutes with a snack break thrown in worth $5?  WFfF reminds me of the flash games I used to play back in the early 2000's. As I remember them, they had a charming, if not minimalist art style, interesting or zany premises and usually did one or two things pretty well for what they were. I think that's a fair generalization of this game.  The game starts off as the player character, who is a professional wrestler, shows up drunk to work and is about to take a fall, giving up the championship belt to another wrestler. After a few clicks through the dialogue and it's now the future. The player character is homeless and goes around a city map bumping into his old friends/rivals from the glory days of wrestling in the WFF. Some are just as down on luck as the player character, others have become high ranking officials in the police department of even government. The player will then decide to talk or fight to solve these former wrestlers' problems.  Humor is a hard thing to capture in a game because humor is not universal. Something funny to someone can be an annoyance to the next. The humor in WFfF is zany and irreverent so I found myself smirking a couple times while playing the game. It's hit or miss but doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to be funny which is a good thing.   The humor serves the dialogue well and the highlight of the game is probably the dialogue system. In certain situations the player will have to convince characters to do things they may not want to do, a screen pops up displaying certain traits about the person the character is talking to and it's up to the player to decide how to tackle the situation. Adopting an agressive style, disagree with the character and do so in a snarky way and the person that needs the convincing may disapprove while assuming a different stance, agreeing with the person and being a little more to the point may be the required combination. It's definitely an interesting and organic way to handle dialogue and when it works, things go pretty smooth, when it doesn't work, I was forced to throw up my dukes and handle things through combat.  Combat is a little too simplistic for my liking, even in a game such as this. There are punches, kicks, and a shoulder charge with rapid pressing of these buttons stringing the attacks into a combo which changes the animation a little bit. My issues are the AI isn't that bright and the combat moves don't feel particularly wrestling-esque. AI will often close distance and get within melee range but since this game plays like an old beat 'em up, the characters can sometimes overlap on the x axis and instead of the computer trying to reposition itself, it will swing blindy over and over until the player moves the character around.  There's equipment in the game that changes stats such as damage and speed and the different stats do have a visible effect on how fast the character moves or the damage that they do but I only wish that there was a change to the appearance of the character too. I think it would be a little toucht hat goes a long way to show that the developer cared about the little things.  There's about 8 locations, a quest or two per map and one of those maps are unlocked once everything else has been solved. The graphics aren't that good with a lot of assets being reused and for some reason there are minigames of sorts that don't amount to anything and aren't very fun.  Oh I asked a question in the beginning and for me the answer is no. Those flash games were little time wasters that were occasionally fun but they were free and some of them were really well done with a bunch of little nuances throw in. Will Fight for Food has some good ideas but it doesn't seem much effort is put into the game to make those ideas shine.  ",-1,0,4713
19980,Prince of Persia,"Prince of Persia (2008) is a super easy game with a cool art style and a Zelda-like combat system. It is a very peaceful and relaxing game. Unfortunately, the characters are stupid, the story is soooo dumb, and you have to grind through a bunch of levels that are the same exact difficulty. Plus, there is A LOT of backtracking in this game. Oh and did I mention that you can't even die or lose?

277590,Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry,"Now, as a long term Assassin's Creed fan I was super god damn excited to play this game when I saw it on sale. However, when I finished it a day or so later, I felt a little disappointed.   This game overall feels more like a couple of long DLC missions in the main game than a stand alone game. It's entertaining enough if you liked Black Flag, because this is basically the same, but on a much smaller, less interesting scale. It feels like you're just playing as a reskinned Edward, as the idle animations are the exact same. You can hunt certain animals, but there's no purpose, because you can't craft or make more outfits. Like in Black Flag, you can plunder other ships, but the rewards are so badly scaled to the prices of the few upgrades, that you're basically decked out after you've pulverized four ships. Freedom Cry feels like someone cut a tiny square out of the bayeux tapestry. It's aesthetically pleasing in itself, but it's lacking a whole hell of a lot of context.   I personally don't feel like Freedom Cry's got enough content or weight to be its own game. I played it, I completed it, it was okay while it lasted, but in a critical light, this really isn't that big of a deal. I would't recommend buying this unless it's on sale.",-1,1,5633

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant. My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life. He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game. At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval. We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.",1,1,9837

Gauntlet was controls on left w/ buttons on the right for action. This is more action based on pointer location.  Then that introduction, where you're forced to play each class . . .   I'm not sure what they were going for, but I don't like what was delivered.  For me this goes on the shelf, at least until the controls are fixed, hopefully they have somone on the staff play the original, and possibly get a coder that isn't hell-bent on that hideous config.

271820,Card City Nights,"I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought 'Why not?' and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.  What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose 'defense' (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.  While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?",1,0,11770

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game. Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say 'well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah' what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.   Cons-   Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.  Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)  Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.  Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).  Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.  Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.  Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.  Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.  Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.  Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.  Not a whole lot of enemy variation.  I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.  No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).  I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.  Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.   Pros  I like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.  weapon special attacks were pretty good.  graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)  Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.  Most puzzles were fun to solve.  Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.  The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.  Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)  Sound effects were done very well.  Potions made are very useful.  For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.  Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.  While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it. I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.  Graphics 7/10 Sound 8/10 Combat 5/10 Gameplay 7/10 Story 4/10 Replayability 9/10  Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.",1,0,11975
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)    The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...    Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.  Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting.

270810,Jones On Fire," Jonas on Fire  it's a simple 2D side scrolling runner game where you have 2 buttons: jump and slide. It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. The player's mission is to guide a firefighter along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, the player will collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more. The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.  The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios. Graphically it's clearly based on  Minecraft  fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.   Jones of Fire  could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions,  Jones of Fire  doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.  I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.",-1,0,8239
233450,Prison Architect,"First off I just want to say I was surprised by how well the campaign was written. I wasn't expecting much but it has quite some emotional impact.  The game itself is fun! There seems to be many possible ways to construct and run your prison, and I'd say the replayability is fairly high. It seems mostly bug-free and is functioning very well. It's mostly a very satisfying experience, if you like these kind of 'build and manage'-games.  It has some problems though. The most appearant is money balance. I'm not sure if I'm just playing it wrong, but I found it hard to earn money in a pace that allowed me to keep constructing and improving my prison without spending a lot of time waiting for money to tick in. There are some small glitches, the most annoying one i encountered was that my doctors kept getting stuck in the walls of my infirmary for some reason. I could fix it by ordering them to move somewhere, but until I did that, they would not function as usual. And after a while they'd end up stuck again. Firing them an rehiring didn't fix it. Some of the requirements for rooms are somewhat unclear. A couple of times I ended up rebuilding buildings because the room wouldn't function, only to later figure out I had made some stupid mistake like not tagging all squares in the building as part of the room. There is a bit of information that is hard or impossible to access in-game, and you have to go look at a wiki or something to figure it out. For example, connecting CCTVs to a monitor only works if you connect from the monitor to the cctv. if you connect from the cctv to the monitor, it doesn't work. There is no tutorial for these things in the campaign and that limitation is so incredibly odd yet mentioned nowhere in the game.  It looks like I've listed a lot of negatives, but most of them are actually relatively minor complaints. I've had a lot of fun with this game and it was well worth the money spent.",1,0,12679

353130,Time of Dragons,"This game...meh. I didn't really get into it. Not my style, you could say, but all things considered, I really just didn't like it. It might appeal to some, but I found the game to be fairly boring in nearly all areas. The dragons didn't seem very interesting or original, at least in my eyes, and were sometimes hard to control in the game itself. I found myelf getting shot from behind quite a lot, dying before I even knew what was happening. This could easily be attributed to my lack of skill in the game, but, ah, well, I really just found it hard not to get shot in the back.    One of the good points, I must add, is that the stats actually make a difference. I mean, some games get me confused as to why I need to up my stealth, or my stamina, or whatever else they can think up., but here it can be very clear as to the weaknesses and strengths of each dragon. That was nice, of course, but everything else sort of faded into the background. The art? I can barely remember it. The music? Was there any music at all in this game?   So, yeah, average game. Could just be my opinion, but I didn't like it. Play it if you want, but don't expect me to recommend it.",-1,1,9441

258970,Gauntlet™ ,this is my first time posting a review. The game is really not worth anyone's time unless they relish in old school arcade style games with no flexibility. If you like POE or DII (DIII sucks in my opinion) you will not like this game. I am sad that I wasted $20 on this game to be honest. I have to completely agree with TraceofHatred's review. Too basic for what you get. Look elsewhere for fun and excitement.,-1,0,9582

233450,Prison Architect,"Figured I should get around to a review of this game after 100+ hrs..  Overview: Prison Architect is a game that allows you to construct, manage, and be sentenced to a prison of your own making with a large variety of features.  I typically do a pros/cons section in my reviews, but it's difficult to do that with Prison Architect. The game gives you the freedom to do pretty much everything with the tools it (or modders!) provide you. The AI for the prisoners and staff isn't bad, negatives like contraband, prisoner tension, and needs are fairly balanced with your mitigation options (Which require some thought in implementation!).  This game is everything you'd expect for what it is. The only true downsides that come to mind is that prisoners don't always satisfy their biggest need first (Such as not using the toliet sitting in their cells before going to the shower, then starting a fight over it.)  Vinal Verdict: Solid 9/10. Great game that's constantly being improved!",1,0,15739

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"Legend of Grimrock 2 (here on referred to as LoG 2) is everything you could want for a sequel and more. I look forward to what the future holds with user generated content.  The Legend of Grimrock series are a set of real time, grid based, dungeon crawlers with pleasing graphics and a good aesthetic.   Movement is based on grid and you can turn left and right also move left, right, forward and backwards. You attack by clicking the weapon of choice from the character portraits. While this is not for everyone, it's stays true to it's roots and will please many after they have adapted.  While the story is a little weak, you will find yourself enjoying the neatly packaged puzzles that are littered throughout the world. I had a problem with the first game where you had to search each wall for secret buttons or risk missing one. LoG 2 improves on this by giving some subtle and some not so subtle hints that the player is missing something and should look deeper, resulting in a less difficult search.  Another area that LoG 2 improves upon is allowing the user access to outside areas, giving more varied feel to the game. There are now many more types of enemies and many of which have varied A.I.  The soundtrack has seen improvements since the first game and has a lovely score of atmospheric ambient noise and battle music for boss fights. The theme tune is catchy but I still see myself returning to the theme song of the first game.  In conclusion my experience with Legend of Grimrock 2 was amazing and to top off it all, there is extensive support of modifications, I look forward to seeing what people create.  Controller Support : Not suitable for a controller. Fully playable with just a mouse.",1,0,17458

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a really amazing game. It's simple yet complicated the same time. You can easily navigate through the early game, and you can easily develop a sense of what's going on and what you're supposed to do to start having fun with the game. Although, the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more it gets complicated. Not in a confusing, irretating way, but in a challenging one. I love the graphic design it has, the mechanincs are really good, the story is also pretty good and the last one, for me, worked like a tutorial. I played the story after I had spent quite many hours creating my own prisons, so playing this mode, helped me understand even further the game's mechanincs, discover new tricks or inspired me to be even more creative. Prison Architect is extremely addicting for me, it's challenging and it is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.",1,0,19156

233450,Prison Architect,"This game is amazingly addicting and way to much controlling every minute of prisoners lives. It should not be this fun. Seriously. 10/10  On that note, I have quite literally just had the most brillant idea for a way to play this game with friends. Allow friends to enter your prison as a prisoner! No building, but instead sees a web of things they can do to get contraban, mess with gangs, become gang leaders or leaders or other operations. (Such as landing a job in the kitchen and then creating a contraban source for so and so item with one of the kitchen staff and racking in the money.) Being able to negotiate with the guards for the best cells, etc. Trying to escape, and of course just causing the most trouble possible for your warden(friend). :D Imagine, one person is warden, and up to four or five friends can join in as prisoners. If a friend escapes successfully or dies in the process, they just come back as a new prisoner! Haha.",1,0,20736

35700,Trine,"Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.  This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.  The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.  To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",1,0,21130

You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc.  You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice. Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc. With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.  Pros : -Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc. -Can be extended further with mods. -Only decent prison management game I know. -Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well. -Prisons can be shared easily through steam. -Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.

Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.  tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help. so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.  bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter. then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?! oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?! i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help. especially the super duper secret ones.  I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.",1,0,33575
233450,Prison Architect,Heartly recommend!!! Great simulation game with sufficient playability.,1,1,33593
233450,Prison Architect,"I adore this game, you should aswell, best prison simulator around. And far worth the price. I backed it on early access and watched it grow into the fine game it is today. The devs are fab, making frequent update videos with indepth change logs.   They are almost finished with this title and are planning on expanding to other projects, keep an eye out for them, because i feel they are going to be of a very similar spectical.",1,1,33621
233450,Prison Architect,"Okay, I first time bought this game when it was in early access alpha 10. Boy, while it was buggy and laggy, I enjoyed every moment the alpha 10 provided and the next alphas as well. Some alphas had major bug fixing, some adding contents and a lot more. I edited a lot pages in the wikia of Prison Architect (The legal ones, aka, dev ones) and so on.  Now it got released. Is it really worth to buy this game? Absolutely YES! Are you the type of city building, money management, staff management, resource management, time management? Then this is your game.  At first you can do tutorial by doing missions. But the truth is, the tutorials do not really help you understand how the game works so you are forced to either watch some youtube videos or just check the wikias.  No problem! The  major positive  here is, the sandbox.   Unlike most other games which their sandbox often end because we filled out everything we had. For example, a survival horror with resources, if we got all resources, weapons to win our enemies, then we have nothing else to do because we got unlimited days to survive, etcetera.  So yeah, the sandbox is kinda limited, ESPECIALLY if you play it without money cheats or with challenges (Gangs, events temperature) and what not. If you got gangs ticked (Means they will make an appearance) it will add a challenge to the game and so on. On the other hand, you got a few guard types, one is a normal guard, one guard dog, one armed guard and so on and each of them got different roles and responsibilities! You can also hire cooks, janitors, gardeners and so on.  What you have to be really careful is, prisoners. They humans and express their needs by anger, arguing, fighting or worse, rioting. Riots is the worse challenge because if the prison is taken and hasnt been stopped for long time, the government will send military to take it over, thus marking it as game over (Unless FAILURE CONDITIONS are disabled).  Now, prisoners can eat, relax, sleep, work or attend to reform programs. That's good. On the bad, they will fight, be in a gang, escape from the prison, attack prison staff or other inmates.  You can build the prison YOU would like. You can make small cells, large cells, small canteen, huge yard and a lot more. NO limitations, you decide what you want! There are a lot rooms, a lot buildings to build, a lot staff to hire, a lot objects to place for a use, everything is everything, the sandbox simply never ends itself. You can even have more than 1000+ prisoners and the sandbox wont end, more challenges will come and more hard stuff.  There is escape mode too where you play as prisoner and escape from a prison, yours or someones. You can hire gangs, use tools to escape and so on but is too simple but fun.  And last pros, there is 3D mode which is very laggy and underdeveloped at the moment. You can download ANY mod you want from workshop!   On cons , the game has some very minor bugs which can be hardly noticeable unless you try hard. The lag is depending of your computer's processor, it has nothing to do with graphics card at most times.  This game is the best prison game I have ever played, better than Prison Tycoon. No other words, just no other words! I vote it...   8.5/10. Personally, I am recommending this game to ANYONE and especially to those who live kind management games which has endless sandbox mode and more good features. I dislike however, some bugs gone unnoticed and some lack features which in-real life prisons have such as multi-floor story, hostage situations and some. ",1,0,33625

507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"I played the original so I knew what to expect. Basically more of everything which is great. I have a nice hardware so this game runs 60 fps for the most part and is a big reason I enojoy it. I actually liked the original campaign and I am playing through the memories one right now.   Really digging the update UI and stategic zoom. Welcome to see the new map types as well as the player cap increased from 6 to 14. The largest maps are still not the size of the redicilous 81km maps in supcom but oh boy are they still very large. I don't know if they should ever make maps that large thought because unit formations can take a while to get places on larger maps. Really like the new upradable buildings as well.   Overall if you like large RTS games like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander you should check it out. The base game felt a tad basic but this one is starting to shape up into something pretty nice. Hopefully the next DLC/standalone adds another race and I would put this right up there with SupCom FA. They have a great engine and I can't wait to see what more they add to the game through patches and expansions/DLC.  Update: After completing all the campaigns. I really like how diverse they all were. Each one focused on a different element than the normal build an army and go crush their base. Can't wait to see more in the future.   The biggest hurdle for me to get over is using all the global abilities like nukes and dropping an engineer, boosting a resource node. And on those large maps you want to be dropping engineers everywhere.   The upgraded towers are so awesome. The vanilla game it really lacked but holy cow can you ever hold down an expansion now with these crazy towers!",1,0,35147
35700,Trine,"Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.  Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult.   Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at most  Rating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.",1,0,35212

233450,Prison Architect,"First of all, I think this is an incredibly awesome game. Given the fact that its still only in alpha, I am extremely excited to see what new updates may come!  Some things I have noticed: None of my guards can start the tazer certification program. All the guards will go into the classroom right as it is about to start, and then when it gets to starting time everyone leaves. This does poes a problem as most of my prisoners are strong, deadly, etc. and having tazers in hand for every gaurd would be awesome.  I am not able to set a punishmeant if one of my prisoners murders anyone else. At first I thought that they might get sent to the electric chair, but they didn't. In fact, it didn't seem like they recieved any punishment at all, and i had to set my own.  Things I would like to see: Prison Gangs: a very real part of modern prisons, this feature would add to the realism of the game. Possibly set it among either in prison gangs or racial ties. Once a prisoner enters a prison, he or she sides with others of their race within the prison, regardless of previous gang affilitiations. Ocassionally, this is not true, but it would still work. Also maybe making snitches targeted by certain gang (i.e. black gang snitch, southern mexican snitch). Snipers and Sniper Towers: I would especially love to see this. A sniper tower with a sniper in it (hired gaurd). Somehow the tower would have to be built as a raised structure, so either it could be a single purchased thing or maybe a building with raised foudations(new foundation type)  Just some things to chew on. Hope this helps   *UPDATE*  I just wanted to update my review as a point. These are possibly the most dedicated devs I have seen. This is happening the day of the third update (I have been playing since alpha) and Prison Architect has Prison Gangs and now Sniper Towers. We asked, they gave. Keep up the awesome work guys.",1,0,39797

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam. This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM! Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros. Pros:   Great soundtrack   Great models   Smooth even on old Computers   Very Colorful   Great time waster   Fast paced   TONS of customization   Plenty of modes   Tons of achievements for a simple game!   Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)  of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect. If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream. Cons:   Hard at first   Not able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)   Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)   It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.   Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.   Not big community   Hard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a server  You should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.",1,1,40429

233450,Prison Architect,"Update after 160 hours!   Prison Architect is 'sandbox' builder par excellance. I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :P  But what's Prison Architect?  You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.  Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison.   Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.   Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox.   Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed.   Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.  Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.  Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants.  Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )  Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death. Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.  Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord. Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)  Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :P  Prisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem. building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies. Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;)  Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry.  There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.  Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.  Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc.   Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.  Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day.  While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer. Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.  Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful. ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prison  Campaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.  There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer. Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.   Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else. There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.  I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.",1,0,44522

35700,Trine,"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'?  No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting.  If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.  Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).  What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.",1,1,44723

270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"Pros: -High Skill Ceiling -Fun Game Mechanics like Catching, Blocking and Trickshots -Cool Power-ups -Super Fast Gameplay -Great Graphics and In-depth Graphical Settings -Fantastic Soundtrack that Matches the Gameplay Perfectly -Low System Requirements -Fun in Single-player and Multiplayer -Cheap Compared to How Good the Game Actually is -Has a Demo (A DEMO in 2015??!?!) so There is No Reason Not to Try it -Four Pack -You Can Buy The Soundtrack -Workshop -THE GAME ISN'T EVEN FINISHED  Cons: I honestly sat staring at my screen for 10 mintues trying to think of something I don't like about this game and couldn't.",1,1,44920
35700,Trine,"I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.  Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought 'Meh, let's see what this is like.' I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.   For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.   8/10",1,0,44962

268750,Magicite,"Magicite is a perfect blend of strategy and fun, combining crafting and collection with fighting and bosses. It becomes even more entertaining when you join your friends in a conquest to beat the final boss. Magicite is a game that you can spend hours on or simply play for fifteen minutes. Either way, there is fun to be had in this epic world.",1,0,45823
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,Awesome game. Although it has a bit of a steep learning curve because it lacks a proper ingame guide. There is a tutorial that explains the basic and together with some tips &amp; guides from the internet you will work it. Its very similar to the Civ series but in space and with some nice feature like a ship designer where you can customize the look and loadout of your own ships. So if you like turnbased civ building games this is a must have.,1,0,46057

251730,Legend of Grimrock 2,"This is essentially Legend of Grimrock, but more. There's a greater variety of enemies, the skill point system is tighter, there are different environments to traverse instead of an eternity of brick-and-moss walls to bump listlessly into, the fan community is generally helpful, and the game *can* be beaten by a casual dungeon-crawler without the need to refer to a walkthrough every five steps. That said, there are several major optional dungeons, old areas repopulate with new encounters after milestones in the plot, puzzle hints are scattered between zones to make back-tracks more productive, and classes have been added to the game, supplementing the new races with a broader range of build options at the game's start.  Grim II is substantially more intuitive, with the worst puzzles being largely optional and timing-gimmick traps an occasional thing, rather than a whenever-the-developers-got-bored kind of affair. Pixel-hunt walls are also less in evidence (although the workshop community is working dilligently to fix that,) and fish restock themselves in ponds and rivers to cut down on starvation-induced unwinnable game-states.   It is still possible to get locked into an unrecoverable state (invincible golems start appearing midway through the plot, and they can wall-abuse you into a corner if you're unlucky,) but rotating your saves will prevent this handidly.  Basically: if you even sort of liked the original game, you're going to have a good time.  If you didn't much care for Grim 1's formula, but you liked Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld or similar titles, this is still worth a try.   The only people I'd suggest give this a miss are people who want a smooth, continuous flow of play ala Halo, CoD, Skyrim, etc. Grimrock is largely about stopping and thinking about how you're going to proceed, and folks who have a strong negative reaction to things like substitution ciphers would do well to stay clear.",1,0,46786

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is a great sandbox game that gives a lot of room and possibilities for one's own creativity and to go full nerd-mod. Designing the perfect prison, the details in planning and organizing, opportunities in starting from nothing until the big of biggest prisons and all the chances something going wrong during that process, makes it really interesting and even after hundreds of ingame hours still fun to play. There is a great development team behind the game and an even greater community that amazes again and again with their own creations and helping side. Even not being totally finished (last update planned for august 2016) it was all the way and will always be an enjoyable game.",1,0,46985

233450,Prison Architect,"If you buy this game, you may just be serving a sentence of your own...as time slips by, engroused in what you are doing. It's a fantastic managment, builder where the unpredictability of the prisoners (and pretty much everything else!) always has you interested.  The Pros: - Just one more thing: Oh how mnay times I've thought 'I'll just finish this bit and then I'll quit...no, wait, I'll do this bit too before I forget....oh and...' - Organised Chaos: Prisoners are fun to watch, can be easy or difficult to manage. I've built only 3 or four prisons (early access) and have had everything from zero problems almost at all, to a riot that started literally 3 seconds after I accidently overpowered my electricity generator (leaving one gaurd dead and many prisoners bloody and unconscious!).  - Loads of space to build - lots of info and lots to do. There's always plenty to do and work on.  - It's just damn fun and a good amouont of challenge  Take or leaves:  - Graphics: I like them, you should not be out off by them. There is a 3D mode, but it dodn't do much for me and I prefer the original personally - Prisoner mode: you can be one of the prisoners and try to escape your own or anyone else's who have shared it in the Steam workshop. It was ok when I tried it but no real sense of actually living in the prison from what I tried. A hit and giggle feature but maybe I need to check it out again.   Cons: - The tutorial and general information on how to actually play and whatthings do is very much NOT clear. I played the campaign tutorial a few times after extended breaks away from the game when it was in early access and I have avoided it this time around since its official release, so it may have been improved. But overall, you will almost certainly need to look up wikis and how to's, often for very simple thing. Thankfully, there is loads of community help and a working answer is easily found.  - Randomness that could be bugs or just lack of info: Sometimes you don't know why things are not working. Sometimes there are unclear clues, other times you 'll be cratching your heads (I have a few armed gaurds and security gaurds that gather together every night in the yard for no apparent reason. They are not scheduled to patrol there, but they do it anyway).   Really though, I find when I have a go at this game, I am sucked in for many long running sessions. Enough depth to satisfy a passionate builder/manager, not too much as to overwhelm. Eg, there are things like circuits and pressure plates, but you most definitely don't NEED them to run a prison (but it would help of course).  Very much recommended.",1,0,48740
