1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",-1,1,1

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots.

Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.

Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",-1,1,91

A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house.

Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1,38

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.

When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",-1,1,122

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.

Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",-1,1,122

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1,38

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",-1,1,8

1355722,"JuegoB","This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1,38

The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots.

Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1,46

270880,American Truck Simulator,"  Having been born in New Mexico, United States, I tend to travel to Arizona, more importantly, flagstaff. I took a shippment from Kingsman AZ to Flagstaff AZ. and it took a while to get from point a to point b. anyways, I smiled when I read 'Albuquerque' when I got closer to flagstaff, my brain went into auto pilot mode when I got to a forested area and I thought 'Yeah, we're getting close to flagstaff.' then I had to pause the game and think about what I just thought about, No other game has ever made me think that.   My point is, this game has replicated some areas in real life pretty close to the real thing, that coupled with a few mods made me forget it was actually a game for a few seconds. Unbelieveable!",1,0,652

383870,Firewatch,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect going in, but from the first sarcastic remark, I was hooked. Though not without its share of flaws (run length, somewhat predictable plot, occasionally irksome backtracking), Firewatch draws you in with an intriguing mystery and some beautiful views, but its two main characters are really what sets it apart. They are both perfectly voice acted and brilliantly characterized.   Pros: Believable, thought out characters Excellent voice acting Witty dialogue Absorbing mystery The ending isn't overdone and fits well That sunset though  Cons: Underwhelming conclusion to the mystery Extremely linear Backtracking Short for the price  Firewatch is more like an interactive art piece than a typical game. Though games of this type are becoming more common, Firewatch really knocked it out of the park in my opinion. 8/10",1,0,696

383870,Firewatch,"Firewatch is a game that sold itself to me primarily on the amazing aesthetics, and I ended up going into it almost entirely blind. This turned out to be a furtunate decision, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it over a bit less than 4 hours, having had few expectations going in. And for the first time in a long time, I did another playthrough of a game very shortly after finishing it (clocking in another 3 hours), in order to see what I had missed the first time around.  Briefly, Firewatch is a narrative game centering around two people, one of whom is the protagonist, Henry, who has taken the job to monitor for the presence of fires in the Shoshone National Forest, from atop a guard tower. The main gameplay element, and the major draw, is the radio that Henry carries during his duties, which connects him with the second major character, his supervisor Delilah. Delilah not only gives Henry tasks to complete, typically involving longer or short trips into the wilderness, but also grows to be a close and familiar presence to both Henry and the player, and their interactions form the backbone of the game. During their interactions, the player has the option of choosing between various responses, or even no response, shaping the narrative between the two. I found this aspect of the game to be incredibly well done, thanks to a great script and the fantastic voice acting performed for both characters. The game is further underlined by an incredible soundtrack, which I found to fit the story and the setting very well, and which makes for great listening on its own.  However, as the narrative is the backbone of the game, more gamey elements take a backseat. There are very minor puzzle elements, and some minor 'collectibles' which allow you to learn about some secondary characters, but these take the back-seat to the narrative between Henry and Delilah. Fortunately, I would argue, as the game would not have been any better in my eyes had it included an abundance of such elements. If I have to make one criticism, it would be that the game could have benefitted from a bit more time spent fleshing out the relationship between Delilah and Henry, before the plot gains steam.  Finally, while some were apparently disappointed by the ending, I will say that I am not among those. In fact, now that I know the full scope of the story, I was eager to play the game again, to reshape the narrative (in some ways) compared to my last play-through, and to see what hints, clues, and   turtles   I missed the first time around. Indeed, playing the game again provided answers to several questions that I had missed during my first playthrough, and revealed additional background information thanks to different dialogue choices, though I did find that this also revealed that certain parts of the conversation were not as flexible as I had hoped. Still, for me, both the game and the soundtrack was worth every cent, and worth playing through twice.   A final recommendation before I finish: By default the game will show your exact location on the map, and pop up notifications when your objective changes. It is, however, possible to turn both of these features off, and I would strongly urge anyone playing Firewatch to do so, as this makes for a much more immersive experience. Furthermore, I would also recommend playing with head-phones, to enhance the already great sound-design, both in terms of the environmental audio and the music.",1,0,280

270880,American Truck Simulator,"  Having been born in New Mexico, United States, I tend to travel to Arizona, more importantly, flagstaff. I took a shippment from Kingsman AZ to Flagstaff AZ. and it took a while to get from point a to point b. anyways, I smiled when I read 'Albuquerque' when I got closer to flagstaff, my brain went into auto pilot mode when I got to a forested area and I thought 'Yeah, we're getting close to flagstaff.' then I had to pause the game and think about what I just thought about, No other game has ever made me think that.   My point is, this game has replicated some areas in real life pretty close to the real thing, that coupled with a few mods made me forget it was actually a game for a few seconds.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has played ETS (The $19.99AUD pricetag is more than justifiable), or those that are on the fence about whether to purchase a truck simulator or not.   Should you be a newbie, and faced with the choice between ETS 2 and ATS, I'd strongly recommend going with ETS 2.   New additions such as police cars that become portable speed cameras and roads that become flooded with tumbleweeds give a fresh feel, but it's still just ETS 2 (not that that's necessarily a bad thing).   7.5/10  tl:dr - It's a good game, but glorified DLC for ETS 2.",1,0,1726

And that's really the only qualm I had (among other vastly smaller nitpicks), will you be able to get the marble to it's ultimate destination?

Though not without its share of flaws (run length, somewhat predictable plot, occasionally irksome backtracking), Firewatch draws you in with an intriguing mystery and some beautiful views, but its two main characters are really what sets it apart. They are both perfectly voice acted and brilliantly characterized.   Pros: Believable, thought out characters Excellent voice acting Witty dialogue Absorbing mystery The ending isn't overdone and fits well That sunset though  Cons: Underwhelming conclusion to the mystery Extremely linear Backtracking Short for the price  Firewatch is more like an interactive art piece than a typical game.

383870,Firewatch,"Firewatch is a game that sold itself to me primarily on the amazing aesthetics, and I ended up going into it almost entirely blind. This turned out to be a furtunate decision, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it over a bit less than 4 hours, having had few expectations going in. And for the first time in a long time, I did another playthrough of a game very shortly after finishing it (clocking in another 3 hours), in order to see what I had missed the first time around.  Briefly, Firewatch is a narrative game centering around two people, one of whom is the protagonist, Henry, who has taken the job to monitor for the presence of fires in the Shoshone National Forest, from atop a guard tower. The main gameplay element, and the major draw, is the radio that Henry carries during his duties, which connects him with the second major character, his supervisor Delilah. Delilah not only gives Henry tasks to complete, typically involving longer or short trips into the wilderness, but also grows to be a close and familiar presence to both Henry and the player, and their interactions form the backbone of the game. During their interactions, the player has the option of choosing between various responses, or even no response, shaping the narrative between the two. I found this aspect of the game to be incredibly well done, thanks to a great script and the fantastic voice acting performed for both characters. The game is further underlined by an incredible soundtrack, which I found to fit the story and the setting very well, and which makes for great listening on its own.  However, as the narrative is the backbone of the game, more gamey elements take a backseat. There are very minor puzzle elements, and some minor 'collectibles' which allow you to learn about some secondary characters, but these take the back-seat to the narrative between Henry and Delilah. Fortunately, I would argue, as the game would not have been any better in my eyes had it included an abundance of such elements. If I have to make one criticism, it would be that the game could have benefitted from a bit more time spent fleshing out the relationship between Delilah and Henry, before the plot gains steam.  Finally, while some were apparently disappointed by the ending, I will say that I am not among those. In fact, now that I know the full scope of the story, I was eager to play the game again, to reshape the narrative (in some ways) compared to my last play-through, and to see what hints, clues, and   turtles   I missed the first time around. Indeed, playing the game again provided answers to several questions that I had missed during my first playthrough, and revealed additional background information thanks to different dialogue choices, though I did find that this also revealed that certain parts of the conversation were not as flexible as I had hoped. Still, for me, both the game and the soundtrack was worth every cent, and worth playing through twice.   A final recommendation before I finish: By default the game will show your exact location on the map, and pop up notifications when your objective changes. It is, however, possible to turn both of these features off, and I would strongly urge anyone playing Firewatch to do so, as this makes for a much more immersive experience. Furthermore, I would also recommend playing with head-phones, to enhance the already great sound-design, both in terms of the environmental audio and the music.",1,0,280

If you are looking for a fresh modern successor to games like Doom and Wolfenstein do yourself a favor and buy this game. atm ive only played the game for an hour but an hour in this game is enough to tell you that this is worth it, the game never slows down, you will always be clearing a room, checking corners,finding a route to the next area, or debating which item will help you the most along the way. 10scaryfastexplodingpokemon/10",1,0,1239

270880,American Truck Simulator,"American Truck Simulator feels more like a downloadable add-on for Euro Truck Simulator 2 than it does a standalone game.  While the locale and trucks are different, the aesthetic and UI remain exactly the same.   Nonetheless, I am thoroughly enjoying ATS, cruising through Nevada, getting my deliveries done. I highly recommend this to anyone who has played ETS (The $19.99AUD pricetag is more than justifiable), or those that are on the fence about whether to purchase a truck simulator or not.   Should you be a newbie, and faced with the choice between ETS 2 and ATS, I'd strongly recommend going with ETS 2.   New additions such as police cars that become portable speed cameras and roads that become flooded with tumbleweeds give a fresh feel, but it's still just ETS 2 (not that that's necessarily a bad thing).   7.5/10  tl:dr - It's a good game, but glorified DLC for ETS 2.",1,0,1726

409390,Marble Mountain,"Marble Mountain is an enjoyable game where a little marble goes on a big adventure. Very much like a spiritual successor to Marble Madness, Marble Mountain focuses on controlling a marble and having it zip through tricky but enjoyable obstacles. The main problem you may come across is that the camera cannot be controlled, but after a while you get used to the quirky auto-movements and are able to make difficult parts with relative ease and enjoyment. And that's really the only qualm I had (among other vastly smaller nitpicks), will you be able to get the marble to it's ultimate destination?  With plenty of levels, appealing visuals, monumental design, and tons of customization for the marble Marble Mountain is a game worth picking up.",1,0,2107

270880,American Truck Simulator,"  Having been born in New Mexico, United States, I tend to travel to Arizona, more importantly, flagstaff. I took a shippment from Kingsman AZ to Flagstaff AZ. and it took a while to get from point a to point b. anyways, I smiled when I read 'Albuquerque' when I got closer to flagstaff, my brain went into auto pilot mode when I got to a forested area and I thought 'Yeah, we're getting close to flagstaff.' then I had to pause the game and think about what I just thought about, No other game has ever made me think that.   My point is, this game has replicated some areas in real life pretty close to the real thing, that coupled with a few mods made me forget it was actually a game for a few seconds.

383870,Firewatch,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect going in, but from the first sarcastic remark, I was hooked. Though not without its share of flaws (run length, somewhat predictable plot, occasionally irksome backtracking), Firewatch draws you in with an intriguing mystery and some beautiful views, but its two main characters are really what sets it apart. They are both perfectly voice acted and brilliantly characterized.   Pros: Believable, thought out characters Excellent voice acting Witty dialogue Absorbing mystery The ending isn't overdone and fits well That sunset though  Cons: Underwhelming conclusion to the mystery Extremely linear Backtracking Short for the price  Firewatch is more like an interactive art piece than a typical game. Though games of this type are becoming more common, Firewatch really knocked it out of the park in my opinion. 8/10",1,0,696

Here is my review after first 30 minutes of play.  Graphics: 8 - Cartoony but perfectly fitting this sort of goofy/cartoony game.  Sound: 7 - Soudtrack is pretty decent so far, the voice acting is quirky but well done. The sound effects could use a bit more variation but it hasn't yet ruined the expeirence.  Controls: 9 - Responsive, So far I only used the wired Xbox360 controller, not the mouse and keyboard or two player (a person on each)  Fun Factor: 8 - So far the game is fun, has a nice storyline and doesn't take itself all too seriously. The feel matches the graphics and sound so I would recommend playing it.  I will return to review after I finish the game for a full review.   Enjoy",1,0,931
