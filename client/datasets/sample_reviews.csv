284950,Pixel Puzzles: Japan,"Its ok for what it is aldow i would not recommend it for a couple of reasons. The first puzzles work just fine the puzzles in the end are frustrating because you keep clicking on that 1 piece you want to pick up only to keep getting the one below it, and also the lack of a save feature i dont get its not like i cant walk away from a puzzle in real life to come back to it later on, well in this game you have to complete it or start over  a button to reset the puzzle rly? why would anyone wanna do that its not like its possible to make mistakes in a puzzle you eather got it or you dont  the puzzles themselves are nice and relaxing, the japanese music i like its relaxing so if you dont mind the biggest minus point of having no save feature you should stil have some good fun with it  i give it 5/10, 8/10 if they add a save feature and 9/10 if they make picking up the piece i want to pick up work",-1,0

2600,Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,Very good game and very good adaption of the system and captures the feel of the world of darkenss very well.

311690,Enter the Gungeon,"if you dont know games like binding of isaac or nuclear throne you can skip this part  the game has a similar concept, you go in a randomly generated dungeon, get items that buff you, and get guns that might or might not be better than the one you already have, but it has its own charm, and i can see that the game's more bullet hell than binding of isaac, so if you liked that genre, hey, thats a bonus,   now...continuing on.  the game is a roguelite, which means a permadeath mechanic, when you die, you die for good (err well, in this particular game you just travel back in time and start over from the begining) , and your character starts from zero again, all the powerfull items you get for your character for that run is gone, depending to some this might be good or bad, to me permadeath means shorter sessions, its perfect for those who just want to waste a couple of hours time for fun and not worry about strategy in the long run (like say, an RPG game). while having permadeath means you start from the beginning of a dungeon again, it doesnt mean theres no progression to be made (it is a rogueLITE after all), at first only a few items or guns are unlocked for you, unlocked here meaning 'you can now find it on runs now', after you play for a bit you start unlocking new items and guns that you have the chance to find in the dungeon, adding interesting milestones for you other than just getting good and reaching the final boss. like binding of isaac, the game is more or less based on RNG, which means you can just find terrible items all day in dungeons on one run and immediately get an S rank gun on your first dungeon on the other run, to me the RNG isnt an issue here, i never really got frustrated by it and hey, thats part of the game.  TL;DR Good bullet hell game with lots of replayability, it wont bore you for quite some time, and you can just play whenever",1,0
209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"Batman:Arkham Origins is pretty good prequel of Akham Series. Gameplay based on previos Arkham games and he actually don't need any changes though, it not so well-balanced like in AA or AC, but still it best Batman videogame. Main advantage of Arkham Origins it's his plot and characters. Story is really great and seriosly hooked you. And perfect actor's perfomance absolutly cosolidate it. You still don't know who Troy Baker is? Well you not my friend anymore:joker:. 8.5/10. I reccomended this game to everyone.",1,0

378610,Valley,"I hardly ever write reviews but this gem deserves it. The game just screams high quality. It looks great. Runs great. Controls are fluid and tight. The story is interesting and combined with the thoughtful music this is just an all-around great game at a great price. Combat is fun and not too difficult but combat isn't the main focus.  I clocked 8 hours and 20 minutes to complete it but I didn't find all the secret doors and the levels are designed such that you could go back and explore more if you wanted to. Personally, as a 45 year old parent with limited game-time these days, I find a well-made title that does what it sets out to do and doesn't overstay its welcome to be very refreshing.  Take a chance and buy this game. Unless you need constant explosions and/or a fifty hour campaign to have a “good game.”",1,0

3590,Plants vs. Zombies: Game of the Year,"**14 Hours as of this review**   Years ago, I used to play a Nintendo DS Lite. Plants vs. Zombies was the best game I have ever played. Years passed, and I moved on to Nintendo 3DS, Xbox 360, and now PC (plan to stay here, lol.) Here I am today, and I picked up Plants vs. Zombies Game of the Year Edition for $2.49 in a Steam sale. Many memories were retained and experienced again. Disregarding those memories, this game proved itself to be a very great game, not the best I have played anymore, due to my wide array of game knowledge, but it does hold a title of awesomeness. Its is very funny, and very fun as well.",1,0

200710,Torchlight II,"This game pretty awesomes. I've been playing it a ton in offline mode and I think it has only ever crashed like one time. That's pretty great for modern games! All the classes can be pretty powerfuls. I've done a good part of 1st playthrough for most builds I could think up and they're all pretty great by the time they hit their 30s as long as you stick with synergistic skills. I love all the easter eggs, like Notch's Mine for examples. The secret end-game area of Tarroch's Tomb is pretty cools in refining your character, but gets kinda farmy after you do it a couple times, but by then you're probably on New Game+++ at least, so you're accustomed to repeating things.  Overall a pretty great game, especially if you're the sort of frood that likes making multiple toons.",1,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"It's like playing Counter Strike with Medieval settings.  This game is a multiplayer only, and I'm very happy with that. And by multiplayer that means it's much better to play this with real people instead of bots. I repeat: THE BOTS HERE ARE NOT FUN TO PLAY WITH (coz they can't feel emotions)   ***WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT*** The sensation you feel when successfully decapitate (or crush, depending on the weapon) your opponent in a single strike is very very very satisfying ***END OF THE NOT-SO-GRAPHIC CONTENT***  Last but not least, I hope the developer will add some new maps, weapons, or even class to make this game more interesting.",1,0

Hours upon hours of just using its multiplayer settings to hide from your friends in prop hunt, destryo some robots in MVM, or go all out capturing the flag and control points in multiplayer. Highly recommend. Despite some very questionable updates and the community belief that Valve just dont really care about this game anymore, after so many years I still find myself popping into a quick match and having some fun. The layout and feel of the game may have changed. But community servers keep the spirit alive.",1,0

8850,BioShock 2,"Just finishd Minerva's Den and yeah that story really got me...  Bioshock 2 as a whole is solid. The actual playthrough was good, but not as thrilling as the original or Infinite. The story wasn't as engaging as the others, but the ending was really good. Minerva's Den was great though. A short DLC that you can spend a lot or a little time exploring. The MD story was very good and the ending was also great. If you liked the original or Infinite, I'd recommend spending some time with this one and the DLC. Just keep your expectations grounded. My main suggestion though is save often. It does crash a lot on PC, which can be really frustrating at times. But if you save reguarly, it isn't too terrible. Still worth a playthrough.",1,0

The gameplay aspect is alright alll in all, but the humor really made it a winner for me. Seeing cable as a giant floating taco halfway through the game and it just keeps getting more nutso.

41070,Serious Sam 3: BFE,"I wanted to love this game because the earlier Serious Sam's were some of our favorite - but couldn't. This one didn't have the humor or the gameplay. It looked like they were short on time and threw Serious Sam into some different half made game. The main melee attack monster is easier to kill (by popping it's eye out) than counterknifing in battlefield 4. The movement is awkward, and where are all the amusing traps from the past games?  The opening helicopter scene at the beginning is just so generic and bad you know your in for dissappointment. There are 3 enthusiastic Serious Sam players in our house, and all 3 give this an enthusiastic thumbs down. So dissappointed.",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"It's a really good game that happens to be targeted by /v/ and the like. They have no real reason to hate it but they've latched onto 'punishing' the developers for DLC with bad reviews. I don't like paid DLC but this game doesn't screw you with the DLC, it's purely optional and adds nothing but cosmetics to the game. The reviews for this game would be great if they just wouldn't allow alpha and beta testers, who aren't even playing the game, to review. Just look at the other reviews. Negative review, but only played for .3 hours. Come on.",1,1

314030,Guilty Gear X2 #Reload,"A decent port of an obscured version of Guilty Gear XX nobody asked for. That said it works and its cool to have. I never played it way back when because cabs for it happened to be rare at the time and due to a deal the home version was apparently Xbox only. That said it may feel pointless with Accent Plus R being a thing and I say otherwise.  It is an alright port and a great deal easier to get into than later versions, not much but something. I would like to see it return to the Steam store and sadly I do not see that happening.  That's pretty much the review. If by any chance you are a newer fighting game fan or a member of the FGC just new to Guilty Gear this and Xrd may be kinder options to you. That's about all I can say.",1,0

238750,Might & Magic X - Legacy ,"I had been a massive fan of the Might &amp; Magic franchise when I was younger, and had been disappointed by the Might &amp; Magic 9. After hearing that they were going to try and create M&amp;M 10 with a retro feel I was hoping that they would rekindle some of the spark that M&amp;M 1 – M&amp;M 8 had.  Unfortunately, this had been another disappointment due to poor and confusing combat/spell systems, character development that is quite unforgiving and leaves me feeling that choice is an illusion and to get anywhere in the game you need a specific build of character.  I felt the limiting of classes to race and the extremely limited choice in character appearance was unnecessary and made the options you had to build a unique character even more obvious. The story telling had been weak and had not been focused on delivering short, clear and easy to follow story line.  I struggle to find any saving graces for the series, except the desire to continue the series. In conclusion I wouldn’t recommend this game to any fan of the original Might &amp; Magic series. ",-1,0

273840,Stock Car Extreme,This is as close as I'm gonna get to experiencing F1 car for $30. This sim is fantastic! Easily one of the best of there. But like with all great sims you will need a wheel with a good force feedback to fully appreciate it.,1,0
234630,Project CARS,"I intially backed Project Cars through their WMD platform as a team member as I enjoyed Shift 2 &amp; was hoping for something similar to Forza or GT on PC but more of a sim. So I was disappointed when the development shifted towards what so many racing sims on PC are, a non car customisable, choose your racing car sim. After becoming bored with the prebuilds I abandoned the forums &amp; discovered on release that instead of receiving a copy of the game as initially promised there was a 50% off coupon in my Steam inventory. Thankfully after a few months the backers received payments from sales but as I was still disappointed from not receiving the game I avoided it until Vive support was added.  Now being one of the few racing games to support the Vive I've been enjoying the game. Racing sims are hugely improved with VR, the ability to judge distances and being able to see elevation changes, just the immersion it offers.  It's worth picking up if you have a Vive, but I won't be backing Project Cars 2.",1,1

242050,Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag,"Never really got into the original Assassin's Creed or any of its sequels, but when I heard about this I put it on my wishlist and waited for it to come up on a steam sale. Got it in the June sale and it's one of the few games that I've paid $35 for and gotten my moneys worth out of.  Great game with great graphics even on my GTX 580 and an engaging story, although I thought the out of animus stuff was a bit weak (or at least not to my tastes). Well worth putting up with uplay for and I'm now actually looking forward to Unity when it comes out. Only downsides I really found with the game were the few glitches/bugs here and there (although nothing gamebreaking) and that after playing 2/3rds of the way through the story the tail/hide missions did start getting a little stale. Ship combat is good fun, as is clearing the decks with sword/guns whilst boarding and little things like the legendary ships and the diving sections were nice bonuses. Definitely recommend getting it if you even remotely like pirate games and some plunderin'!",1,0

34410,Death to Spies: Moment of Truth,"You play a Soviet counter-intelligence officer during World War II and your job is to infiltrate the Nazis, steal secrets, kill certain individuals and help dismantle the enemy from the inside.  I'm still in the process of playing this game and I love it. It's incredibly difficult at times as the enemy AI is pretty smart and will recognize odd behavior (which can vary depending on which uniform you've disguised yourself in). This is a game that takes stealthy undercover spy work very seriously. If you run-and-gun, you're as good as dead.  The best part is that you're free to complete your objectives however you see fit! Say there's a high ranking Nazi official you've got to assassinate. Do you want to plant explosives on the runway so his plane explodes when he lands or do you want to impersonate an SS officer, get the official alone and stab him? How about take him out from a distance with a sniper rifle? Those options (and tons more) are available.",1,0
99810,Bulletstorm,"I snagged this today on the Steam Holiday Sale. No problems downloading, activating and playing. I only played it for 25 minutes. But Really like it. It will get a serious worout. Graphics are awesome. As one of the earlier posters said; I think you have to have a XBox Live Account for a glitch free process. It uses my XBox Live Gamer tag info. But plays flawlessly in single player and multiplayer. After I get some SP experience with it. I'd love to get some multiplayer reps going. So stay tuned. Great shooter so far.",1,0
214340,Deponia,"For a game about garbage, it certainly isn't trash.  Wow!   I played Deponia like I was watching a movie, beating it in the span of one day. I was so into it I even 100%ed the game too (that Droggeljug achievement though, XD). While this may not be the best way to play games, I still found it a fun enough experience to commit to completing it over the course of most of a day off (no regrets)!  Just a quick recommendation, don't be afraid to use a guide with this game. Some of the puzzles are pretty brutal and take place over a couple different areas. This isn't to say the game is unreasonable, all the puzzles are logical, but it's easy to make only a cursory look-over of an area and end up spending an unnecessary half-hour looking in other places for a small, yet important item. You can only have so much free time (cough, cough). Plus it's less satisfying to when you solve one of these 'puzzles' making you think 'What? That was the solution?' rather than 'Yay, me and my smartness figured things out!'.  Either way, this game is an engaging point-and-click adventure with a sense of prominent humor and an expansive story that goes through 2 more games. Its world and environments are very stylistic, well-contrasted and full of awesome characters (that I hope to be seeing again in the next couple installments).  Do yourself a huge favor and at least try the demo because Deponia is definitely worth a buy!",1,0
299160,Empress Of The Deep 2: Song Of The Blue Whale,Very good second part of a trilogy. Your journey continues in a new environment with more puzzle and riddles to solve. Again you try to piece things together with the help of the same friendly voice and a mysterious whale entity.,1,0

108710,Alan Wake,"I played Alan Wake when it was released in 2010 on Xbox 360, I marathoned it, playing for entire days. Then when it was released on PC in 2012 I played through the DLC missions. Now that I upgraded to a 1440p monitor in 2016, I'm playing through the main game again. For a Direct X 10 game it's visually stunning, I love the steven kingesque story. Originally Alan Wake was going to be released on PC in 2010, I think it's annoying Microsoft made it an Xbox 360 exclusive for two years, but that version was pretty good too. If it takes an extra two years to polish the game I think they should, Alan Wake is one of the best games I've ever played.",1,0

377840,FINAL FANTASY IX,"I'm really enjoying the game so far. While it's just the fact my computer is a bit meh, I get lag on the FMV's, I can skip them and just continue with my game. Chocobo Hot and Cold still owns my soul as it always did before. Now onto my impressions. I'm very impressed with how the game looks. The backgrounds don't look awkward despite the new retextures of the characters, and I mean every character has been updated. Even the moogles look like they're fuzzy now. There are nice boosts that can be turned on and off if needed. In order to enjoy the game as its intended, I'd just use them when you're level grinding, and if you find the music repetitive while doing the grinding, you can turn the sound off and just put on your own music. Still as far as I've played this game is very faithful to the original, and it's been sorely missed. If you haven't tried it, I would STRONGLY reccomend this version over the psn version. The psn version is not optimized for widescreen tv's so it looks extremely pixely and does not do the game justice.",1,0

205950,Jet Set Radio,"Not quite sure what to make of this. Can't seem to get the hang of the controls. Granted, it's from a different era, but I have to wonder if something got lost in the process of porting it to the PC. The funky cheerful dystopia of Japanese indie rock punk skater living is more fun to watch in anime, or imagine in art, than to actually play in this game.  So, it's a mild recommend, 5-6 out of 10, as a playable music video. Kinda frustrating as a game. I want to say the learning curve and rewards for progress are better in early Tony Hawk skating games.  Update: I changed my mind. I had to put this down as a not-recommend to balance out all the cultishly positive reviews. It's not nearly as good as the 90+ percent approval that it's getting on Steam. Again, it seems to have benefitted a lot from nostalgia, but it doesn't hold up today.  Does anyone know if it's actually fun to hang out with Japanese skater punks? Anyone?",-1,1

17450,Dragon Age: Origins,"There are RPGs that draw you inside their own unique world, there are RPGs that feel boring and colourless... and there are RPGs that could almost provide the perfect roleplaying experience, if only their gameplay wasn't that dreadful.  Dragon Age: Origins belongs into the latter category. Indeed the storyline is far from new and largely inspired by the classic 'Humans, Dwarfs-living-in caves, elves-living-in-forests' scenario. The idea of a dark threat lingering in the depths, waiting to eradicate the known world is also nothing new in the RPG world. Dragon Age: Origins however manages to put a decent emphasis on the roleplay part. The fact that your possible dialogue options merely consist of the standard 3 ones (polite, not interested and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) does come as a little off, though.  Yet, I do not recommend this game and that is because of the gameplay. Unfortunately, DA:Os story just isn't good enough to turn it into an 'interactive-movie' kind of game. Therefore, the game has to rely on decent gameplay features such as world connection, quality of travel and most importantly battle mechanics. It is these features that take away the fun, in my opinion. The world is not open, but divided into towns and outposts with 'level-like' areas connected to them. The battle mechanics rely on you pausing the game and giving 10 different orders before you start the fight and probably fail due to someone not being healed quickly enough. Even repeatedly pushing an attack button is more fun than this approach Bioware has taken to the game.",-1,0

241540,State of Decay,"while the game is fun at first, it will get very hard very quickly so dont get too attached to any of your playable characters dont gear them too well and dont gear them too little, if you search for a game that feels like the walking dead, as good as it is and as close as this game gets to it...its not. And here is why:  -There are 'special' Zombies similar to left 4 deads playable zombies (hunter, tank, boomer) that make the game unneccesary harder than it already is and take away from the the walking dead zombies feeling.  -There are set Buildings out of wich you are able to make a homebase and there are only a handfull of them around the  whole map and on top of that for some you HAVE to have enough survivors in your group to be able to move in  -No Roaming survivors only stationary groups you can visit and do stuff for them.  -No Bandits, you will never get attacked by bandits neither your base nor in the map somewhere.  -Wierd Controls  -No firstperson mode  i personaly dont recommend this game but that doesnt mean that it is a bad game. it leaves much to be desired but it is a step in the right direction on the road to a perfect Zombie apocalypse feeling.",-1,0

It can get both repetitive and grindy after a while, making you not want to go back at times... but if you follow a pattern and take your time, you'll probably do faster and better than I did as the game is structured to help you ease your way to Level 100 in no time.   The worst part is that the game doesn't really satisfy/reward you for levelling up/unlocking achievements other than levelling up and unlocking achievements. If it actually had customization, I would probably play longer. 55/100.",1,0

391540,Undertale,"Okay, first off; yes, you should play it. Gameplay is solid, characters are charming, humor is funny, and I believe a good amount of people will enjoy it.  Second and more importantly, as I went along my fanboying craze about this game, I started to realize I did a disservice to some friends for recommending they play in THIS SPECIFIC WAY. I got legitimately upset by going against the grain because I felt like there was only one real way to experience it. I hated that in hindsight, but I understand why I did.   And that's when I realized the beauty of this game. If you do it the way you want, you'll get what amounts to a game that is set to your ideal play. You get that experience. That is yours.   Undertale is a game that adapts to YOUR playstyle in a way that is subtle and effective. You play the game and think 'I wonder what would have happened if I did this instead?'. It doesn't go right up to you after a decision and outline what you did and how it changes the ending. You have to wait until later to really get the gist of what you did and how it changes things. Still, that sense of mystery creates curiosity, especially considering how charming the characters all in general.  That curiosity is a huge aspect to this game. It makes the alternative more powerful if you play it again, even if the alternative is distasteful to you. You wonder what would happen if you made a different choice here. You experiment with that. And the game rewards that, in its own way.  If you get this game, try and play it the way you want first. There is no 'strong' ending. There is no 'weak' ending. There is only your first ending, and where you want to go from there. Play it how you would first and enjoy it. Then dig deeper. I promise that curiosity will be rewarded greatly.",1,0

219740,Don't Starve,"Don't Starve is...It's really amazing, to be simple about it. It's one of those games that can make you as angry as you've ever been without driving you away. I'll go ahead and get to the point.  Don't Starve in and of itself is a great concept, simple at face but so very intricate and complex in the inner mechanisms. You'll find yourself dying multiple times due to your sheer overconfidence, feeling like you've judged the situation properly but dying due to your own malfunctions. There's so much to do, so many different ways to survive, and a huge open world that's generated differently each time in front of you. You can change and edit the world you wish to explore to your own standards, which is amazing.   The crafting mechanic is really well made and I love that you have to build higher tiers to get better things. The sanity is so easily overlooked until the moment when everything starts going grey and the monsters from your mind start trying to murder you. There's so much in this game, and it's all really, really wonderful. 10/10 ",1,0
209870,Blacklight: Retribution,"I see a lot of negative reviews from long time players. Dont let them put you off, this is a truly awesome game! Blacklight recently recieved a MASSIVE patch, which changed weapon balance and recoil dramaticly. The developers are closely watching community reaction to this and this may be patched. Weapon balance is still pretty good and the starting weapon, the default AR, is still one of the strongest weapons around. Which brings me to my next point this game is not pay to win all guns, gun parts, depot loadouts, and armour are all unlockable by in game currency. Most of these though are behind a level wall which you can use real money to unlock. Most camos and emotes and heroes are only unlocked by real money. The community is great though we no longer have global chat. The new company that owns this game (HardSuitLabs) are very involved with the community.",1,0

Campaign seems like it is done well. On lower levels you can storm through anything, but later levels, whenever you take out an enemy structure, another structure starts puts out more enemies, which means their pathing is different, so you have to figure out how to outflank them again. It's not very difficult, but it is a lot of fun. I'd definitely buy it if you like RTS games.",1,0

200710,Torchlight II,"Best ARPG I've played to date. Why?  - Casual gamer Friendly!  - Although there is, what may seem at first, a limited number of classes the skill selection makes for at least 3 or 4 different sub-variations for each class. Replay value is great, although leveling is a test of patience. Capping taking roughly 2 complete playthroughs.  - Graphics are not as hard on the average CPU that us mortals can afford. I prefer stylized graphics over realistic graphics because they are never out of style or look dated like most other 3D games.  - It offers an Endgame consisting of Mapworks, a tool that allows you to run random dungeons of a level of your choosing (up to 105), and Tarroch's Tomb, a relentless 10 wave gauntlet that drops loot every wave you beat but disappears if you die (Wave 1 comprised of lvl 100 enemies and wave 10 of lvl 199 enemies).  - The loot system actually feels FAIR!!! *coughs* Diablo III *coughs*  - Moddability adds heaps to the game including a difficulty increase and class changes that increase replay value. Downside is modded game saves are different than stock and you can only play with people that have the same mods. Items can not be crossed from modded to unmodded.  - If you get bored or just want to test limits you can duplicate items for money or utility by using a stash and save file manuever. You could also use console to spawn items but you will be labeled as a cheater. The ability to do these cheats adds a lot to the experienced of a gamer that is NOT HARDCORE. Casual gamers need to be catered to too.  The only real downside I found was the relentlessness when making ability choices.  MARK MY WORDS: You cannot respec more than the last 3 abilities you leveled or chose. This means you must level up a character from scratch to try a different build and will probably have to make 2 almost identical characters to fix a stupid choice mistake you made on your first try at a class. Some people love this feature but I believe it would be better if you could just have 2 sub-class slots like you have in WoW or if you could get an option to reset points after completing the game. Just my 2 cents.  Please buy this and enjoy.",1,0

22310,Rogue Warrior,"I was bored and hunting for a game I played on console, and thought might be even better on PC. I saw Rogue Warrior, and couldn't pass it up! I had some great times with this game on Xbox 360, and now I can do it all over again with a superior version! The PC version runs great, controls with a Keyboard/Mouse, and has native xbox 360 controller support if you want it. Options are minimal, but still much better than console.  How is it? Here's an example: Once I was doing nothing more than walking down a hallway in an empty building, with no enemy in sight. My character started talking about his balls in a manner that seemed to be instucting someone on how to pleasure them with... extreme dedication and vulgarity. It was the most random thing that ever happened me in a game. It was hilarious, I was actually in tears laughing. Then I found some dudes and stabbed them many times. There was much death and fun. Rinse and repeat, mix it up a little with guns and such.  If you are like me and have a special place for the (excuse the cliche') 'So bad it's good' type of game, then Rogue Warrior is the golded turd you have been waiting for! You will be wading up to your knees in stealth violence, all while hearing the most insane &amp; horrible, yet perfect voice over a game has ever had,   Buy this game, or you hate yourself, and so does Richard Marcinko, and he will come and murder you with his balls.",1,0
328730,Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey,Very enjoyable game. Use words to damage monsters. It has light RPG elements to it to build your character to do more damage/take less damage. There are numerous combinations to use in the game thereby offering a fairly rich variety of things to try. The equipment and the upgrades do make a material difference as to whether you'll win a level. And the part I like is that you can pretty much build any combination and still win (which cannot be said for quite a few RPGs which are very equipment centric).   The achievements can all be reasonably accomplished. I completed all the levels and most achievements in one play through without paying too much attention to them. The last few took a bit of grinding. The 3000 words took a lot of grinding.   My playing time is a fairly accurate reflection of one play through and the grinding to get to 3000 words. For a few bucks definitely worth it if you like word games.,1,0

It's not the fun Flat Out stands for.. not half of it. Cars upgrades are just a joke. Damage of cars is just shown as a 0-100% health-meter. No race campaign mode, just a chain of random events where you can jump through.  There is no radar, minimap or track info.. you need to know the tracks. You can view back but ( at least for me ) the rear view is delayed on pushing the key and there is delay on releasing the key. Very annoying while driving.  The game doesn't show you your speed or RPM. I'm just missing this.  There are many cars to unlock.. and then you need to buy them ( which is somehow expensive ). But if you finished one event.. you can play it again.. but you don't get more money for it. You can upgrade your cars which is expensive too. Actually I don't know how to make enough money to buy later cars and some upgrades.  Knockout mode is not working because of broken hit + knockout detection.

261640,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,"Alright so a lot of people kind of hated my review so I thought I would revamp it a bit.  Borderlands The Pre-Sequel is truly a 1 of a kind game. It mixes RPG with suprisingly funny humor and characters you just can NOT hate, with a character selection which is so hard to choose from this game had me at a crossroads at night thinking, Clap-Trap or Nisha. This game is an amazing 'pre-sequel' to Borderlands 2, although if you haven't played Borderlands 2 I HIGHLY recommend you play it before you even begin to look at this game.  Pros:  &gt; No gravity? Ummmm HELL YEAH! Having no gravity on the moon is simply amazing. It makes you feel like you own the world when you are in a double jump for example, or just bouncing off of an enemy just for the lols!  &gt;Side missions. Right off the bat there are TONS of side missions to do. If you are a side mission fanatic (like me) then BLPS is where you want to be.  &gt;Dialogue. Hehehehehe, is me basically everytime Jack or some other characters smart off to my character and just hearing the response makes it even more hilarious!  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Cons:  &gt;Combat. I just want to start off by saying that it may just be me that is having this issue, I haven't looked into it deeply enough yet to be sure. Close combat with BLPS is sort of tricky, when an enemy gets closer it seems as if you can't shoot as fast, if he is right up on you... you would be lucky to get in 2 shots before he killed you.  &gt;Rendering issues. My friend and I observed that there are a few rendering bugs but none that would make the game too too difficult to play. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I will update my review as I have played more so yeah!",1,0

17470,Dead Space,"One of the most challenging games I've played to date, and yet one of the most fun. Dead Space sucessfully combines the horror element of a game with an excellent storyline. It makes you feel like you are completely alone, even though you've got friends talking to you over the radio. And unlike games like Amnesia and Penumbra, it doesn't warn you when there's a monster nearby, so you get a heck of a surprise. And ammo is extremely limited, so you can't just blast through the levels. All of these elements combined actually guide the player to look at their surroundings, which adds even more to the horror atmosphere. Pretty much the only thing I'd change is the level guide that tells you where to go. It would be a bit more fun and challenging if you had to figure out where to go next on your own.",1,0

8930,Sid Meier's Civilization V,"Between the original version, the Gods and Kings expansion, and now Brave new World, I've accumulated 500 hours of gameplay, and it doesn't look like that's stopping any time soon. By itself, Civ V is one of the best strategy games I've ever played; with the right mods (of which there are plenty), it becomes truly addictive. Generally, one of my biggest gripes with empire-building games is that your empire supports your military conquests. In CiV, your military supports your empire. I have maybe one game in ten where I'll initiate a war; most of the time, I'm way too busy creating the most dominant empire in the land. And it varies every time: right now I'm pushing a game where my religion covered half the globe; the game before that, my scientific accomplishments were second to none. Every game is different; if you play the same way every time, you're not going to get far. I can't emphasize enough how important it is to get both expansion packs. Gods and Kings was praised for adding the religion mechanic, but its primary benefit is a major revamp of the combat system and technology tree that makes both of them so much more neat and logical. Brave New World drastically alters both the culture and the diplomacy victories, and both are for the better, forcing you to put effort into those victories through the whole game. And get mods. I can't tell you which ones to get, but absolutely get some. As you play the game, you'll start to notice little things you wish it did differently. And 90% of the time, someone's already made a mod to fix that. I'm playing with over a dozen right now. Some make wonders more usable, some add more luxury resources or religions, one of them makes scouts usable past the medieval era and another removes the cap on XP you can get from barbarians, and a whole mess more. I've actually reached a point where I'm mixing and matching my mods based on what type of game I'm trying to run. This game will very likely become my #1 most played game, and pretty much the only thing that's going to stop me from accumulating 1,000 hours in it is Life. Put this game on your wishlist, pick up the expansion packs during steam sales, and get addicted.",1,0

218060,BIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien,"I'll better review this game before my aggravation caused by the difficulty of the last few levels kill off any objectivity remaining.   'This game is best played using a controller'.   Then why the helvede is there no support for my (relatively) old Logitech Rumblepad 2. Even tried binding the buttons to keyboard presses using the Logitech profiler software, but those petty tricks is no match for this game's stubbornness.  Anywho, onward and upwards with my trusty wired gaming keyboard. This proved less than optimal, as there's a really noticable input lag. I know it's part of the game design that you remember the pattern of the obstacles anyways, meaning that you should be able to simply adjust the timing of memorized keypresses. But under normal circumstances good reflexes can make up for what you forget - so NOT being able to do so in the very last stages of the game ups the difficulty A LOT.  Lower the difficulty to grandma mode you say? NEVAH!  The first 85% of the game is mostly smooth and enjoyable sailing, but the last parts had me yelling at the monitor. It didn't seem to mind though.  If it weren't for the aforementioned technical problems, I'd give this charming rythmic platformer a respectable 80%, but I can't justify more than 65%.   ",1,0

371660,Far Cry Primal,"OK OK. So, I spoke too soon (SEE BELOW). Anyone reading his, hang in there. As the game matures, the game gets better and the annoying factors are mitigated with the protagonist's (your) skill and resource development. And yes, there is even a quasi-story. I'm finally likin it... and totally impressed with the graphics/art-work etc. WOW!! So, I've changed my NO to a YES. HOWEVER, I am sticking with the CONS described below... ...bottom line: a little less killing and gore (of and by animals and humans) and a bit more strategy would have been good.   Far Cray Primal is a far cry from its predecessor Far Cry 4. It is like A BAD SEQUEL TO A GREAT MOVIE. The graphics are great. HOWEVER, there are too many negative aspects that RUIN THE FUN FACTOR: too much brainless, unnecessary, and random killing (Far Cry 4 was more than a mindless shooter); too many VERY annoying attacks by wild animals (if this were real life, you wouldn’t be able to take a crap without being bitten in the ♥♥♥ and the human species would never have survived); I never used fast travel in a game but now I need to (to get away from those pesky creatures… beautiful as they are – I wonder why I’m killing them at all); the gore is way over done; travelling from one place to another is frustrating because there are WAY TOO MANY predators (animal and human); oh ya, and my pack is full of meat and not enough arrows (hardwood hunting has become a bore). I could go on. JEERS to the testers. Whatever they were on, I DO NOT want to share. After loving Far Cry 4 from the start, I am disappointed.

363680,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada,"I don't really recommend this. It was billed as a RTS with an emphasis on the scale of the battles and ships. Of how customizable the ships are, and so on/so forth. Except there isn't any real scale to the battles, or depth to the mechanics, and the customizability is pretty limited(in campaign at least)  AI isn't very intelligent. Your ships will maneuver like idiots and ram eachother if you don't micromanage them, and often times their too slow to be able to catch anything thats gone out of range anyway.   As a whole, the game plays like Rebellion(really really old star wars turn based strategy) and you go into missions with your fleet a certain number of times per turn. The missions are either stupidly easy (protect the data, you just run for 2 minutes and then jump) Or stupidly impossible(prevent planetary bombardment? HA)   the missions themselves take 4-5 minutes usually, and thats if you get them right, there is no quicksave or quickload system, so you have to return to the main menu if ♥♥♥♥ is not going well to reload and try again.   There are many upgrades for your ships, however they're slight upgrades and you won't really see a major difference between a ship with an extra shield or one with armor piercing ammo.   Nitpicks everywhere. No fleet formations, no tactics for the ships other than attack or don't and which range. a frigate plays exactly the same as a battlecruiser. not to mention the low as ♥♥♥♥ unit cap the campaign limits you to.   The game also tends to crash on me. Though i've played 7 hours, I've managed to have it crash 4 times completely randomly. Usually in battles, but not consistantly.   Finally, i realize the universe of WH4k is supposed to be 'gothic' and i've even played other games before without a problem, but i can't help but be annoyed by the pompous cliche jackasses who are my characters 'superiors'",-1,0

238090,Sniper Elite 3,"I pre-purchsed Sniper Elite 3 as I had already bought Sniper Elite 2 + all the DLC's for SE2 and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the entire package. I'd gone through the campaign several times, mostly at Marksman level (my personal favourite - I enjoy lining the diamond up for a shot), but also at Sniper Elite, mostly for the achievement. Sniper Elite 2, after hundreds of hours playing time is still a game I like to 'dip back into'; play a particular level in a different way, setting myself a particular challenge or go for an obscure achievement, or just play for the extra points and pure pleasure of the graphics and settings. This cannot be said for all campaign WWII shooters, some can get very predictable and can only be played in a certain way which you will realise after only a couple of plays through, so I'm really pleased to be in the Sniper Elite camp. Sniper Elite 3 proved to be even more superior in all aspects than SE2. Once again, hundreds of hours into the game and I am still looking forward to playing each mission over and over again. Still finding areas of the maps I havent explored, and after maybe 5 times through I can honestly say each time has been a completely different experience. The only thing that will hold you back as you sneak through the North African settings will be your own imaginative methods and skills. The cam-kills never get dull for me, and being able to retain stealth while I systematically silence and destroy airfields/factory's/gun emplacements etc is truly satisfying. One (constructive) criticism is the subdued enemy response to my attacks. While it really is real fun to creep through missions sniping with sound cover or silently downing enemies as I tag and find them, sometimes it seems the realism is lost as after a short period of 'alertness', comrades of the dead just seem to resign themselves to the fact that the garrison (or whatever it is) they are stationed at is slowly but surely being annihilated. There is no heightened sense of alarm. It is possible to hide bodies, which is an amazing feature, but what with the enemy not seeming to care too much, after a minute or so, that another of their comrades has been found dead, there wasn't a great deal of incentive to use it for me. I won't comment on the MP as I haven't played it enough to appreciate it, but definitely from what I have played its all thumbs up from me. Atmospheric, tense and immersive, and definitely a game you will go back to over and over again. More Sniper Elite (4?) please : -)",1,0

240760,Wasteland 2,"the more I play the more I enjoy it. I dont get negativity except that its probably from add kids. The storys not that linear multiple ways to finish missions. But no real evil option for the end. at the end of the day your a ranger but how you help the rangers is up to you.  Comabt is cool, but a little over powered towards the end but I find that true with most RPGs, hell in F02 when I had a plasma rifle and power armor I was a walking god  I wish certain weapons made more sense especially heavy weapons and I would love body part targeting like fallout, but its no big deal.  I love the group banter, Ralphy is awesome even though he is a 13 year old kid who is slightly psychotic.  Theres a fair amount of work in the radio adds and for some reason I enjoy the samson and his book song.  But what made me say this is a clasic through and through was when you first get to seal beach. Mathias has a great sense of humor.  It defiantly has replay value as you get either be a fair ranger or super evil hard ♥♥♥.  tons of little things that are great, from finding et cartridges, getting stuck with a dog. I dont see why theres any negativity, if enojoy fallout 1+2 this is pretty solid, not as great as Fo2 with options, but F02 party system sucked donkeys. theres things about both games that were a little off but none of those distract from how great the game is.",1,0

Basically, this game is 1/4 of the price of the newest release, and CONSIDERABLY better.  Simulation is in-depth and chock full of charts, graphs, and data overlays. Build whole, huge regions of billions of sims, with cities all interconnected to form vast metropolises. Plot sizes are up to 16x larger than the newest Simcity (2013) and they directly border their neighbours, allowing you to build a large city over the course of several plots. Not only that, but when linked they can share demand and resources very easily.  In short - buy this.",1,0

375430,The Logomancer,"I honestly can't recommend this highly enough. Between the original premise, non-stock art assets and music, creative puzzles, better-than-average writing, competent dungeon design, and a decent chunk of optional content . . . this game is good. Really, really good.  The basic premise is that you finalize contracts for a company with people who can make permanent structures in the shared dreamscape that the people of this world visit in their sleep. Most things people create while sleeping vanish, but logomancers can create things that last, and other people can experience those things in their sleep, etc. So it's a skill in high demand. Anyway, you can do the bare minimum -- meet the local logomancer, 'test out' his latest dreamscape creation, get him to sign the contract, and then leave town. 2 or 3 hours, ending triggered, game over.  Or . . . you could visit the other townspeople, assist them with a number of side quests, visit other areas of the local dreamscape. As you do so, you'll occasionally come across various bits of weirdness that hint at a greater mystery. Needless to say, most of the optional content(to get the 'true ending') ties into this mystery, which you can in fact solve. And once you've done that, there's even a little bit of post-game content that gives you just a bit more information if you can beat its super bosses. The game took me about 23 hours to finish in its entirety(minus 1 super boss), so I'd guess there's at least 15 to 20 hours of content for most people.  As far as I can tell, no stock assets were used in this game. From the tiles to the sprites to the music, it's all unique. I'm not going to lie -- body proportions are weird, the colors can be very vivid and jarring, but . . . you can tell it was all done by the same person, so there's a consistency. Love it or hate it, you have to admire that someone went through the trouble of making their own stuff instead of using the RPG Maker stock art. And personally, I thought it all worked together really well once I got used to the style.  The battle system has some neat things going for it. Under the surface, it's pretty much what we're used to. Elemental and non-elemental attacks/defenses, health, magic points, various status effects, and the such. However, it's the trappings that make it so special! Instead of regular battles, you have conversations or debates. Your opponents in the waking world are other people, and in the dreamscape the foes take the form of abstract concepts, logical errors, grammatical errors, and the such. The 3 basic elements are ethos(ethical thinking), logos(rational thinking), and pathos(angry/emotional thinking), and manipulating and taking advantage of those states in order to do the most 'damage' makes up the basic layer of combat, and you gain access to a number of skills as you level up(or learn from books) that mix this up. I love that this game lets me drop ethical opponents with a Modus Ponens argument. That's just a bit of magic right there.  Not going to lie. There are some flaws. Getting some of the items necessary for the 'true ending' and the post-game content can be kind of maddening. Even if you pay careful attention to everything that's said or every note you read, stumbling across some of it seems to be just dumb luck. There are a couple walls you can walk through that I'm not sure how you're expected to find them; I got lucky and just stumbled on them, but I read that other people had a lot of trouble with them. And one of the superbosses is hiding in plain sight with nothing to indicate that you're about to fight something huge; nothing tips you off that it's not a normal enemy fight until it's too late, and you have to beat it and get its item drop in order to do the post-game content. And the water spine cave puzzle is just horrible -- I Googled the solution, and even seeing the explanations(it's a base-5 counting thing) didn't help; the picture you're supposed to decode to get the solution still makes no sense to me.  Also, another interesting thing just to illustrate how much work went into this -- you can't really sequence break. For example, there's a 'find the journal' side quest at one point. You can talk to A, then B, then go to X, read D, then go to Y and solve puzzle Z to find the journal. Or . . . you can go straight to the puzzle, get the journal, and return it to A without breaking anything at all. And that's just one example. This game really encourages you to explore, and it doesn't punish you(except perhaps by you running into enemies you're not strong enough for yet) for doing so. Go ahead. Do some things out of the normal order. The game can take it. Sometimes doing things in the 'wrong' order gets you slightly different dialogue, too. For another example, there is a little time at the beginning of the game when you only have 2 party members. The 3rd joins you very soon if you follow the main story path, but you can wander around and do a number of things before getting her to join you, and the dialogue will be a little different than if you'd had her in your party while doing those same things.  All things considered, I give it a solid 8 out of 10. It could have been darn near perfect, but a couple non-game-breaking bugs and the obtuseness of certain things I mentioned above take their toll. Still, all in all, a highly recommended experience.",1,0

360430,Mafia III: Definitive Edition,"Alright. So i have decided to not play this game past 2 hours just in case this fps fix ever gets released. And if it does, i want to have 1 hour left to test it. So here is my thoughts on the game after playing the first 2 missions, and i took the time to get out of my car and look at some textures, some animations, and stuff like that. Just to get a quick first impression of what this game is.  I run GTX 1080 rig with the lastest nVidia drivers, basically a PC that runs games like GTA V &amp; The Division all maxed out in over 60fps.  The first thing i notice is that this game can not run in window borderless, it's either windowed or fullscreen, which is the second hint that this company had no plans of making a good pc version of this game, the first hint was the fps cap. Neither 2k or Hangar13 said anything about a fps cap, until the game was released, when pc gamer wrote an article on it. Then the popular youtuber totalbiscuit started asking questions, and that's when 2k made a statement.  This statement does not specify anything other than that they know the game is running in 30 fps and that higher fps will come soon.  They do not say how many fps or what soon means . But it is likely they are trying to keep people playing and hoping, so that they pass their 2 hour steam refund mark.  It makes absolutely no sense to release a game in this state if they knew how to avoid it. No sense at all. So i will take all they say with a few hundred grains of salt.  Releasing a game to reviewers, the very people that are there to critizise your product, in a state that, in their words, will be fixed 'very soon'. Yeah right.. Very logical.   One thing that does make sense however is why this game had a review embargo.  TBH this game seems unfinished. The graphics looks like they are at least 5 years old. The city and the scale looks really good, but it looks like the entire game is upscaled.  This is a game that is not worth the price they are currently asking , not even close. I will put a hold on my refund atm, and see if a fix will arrive, but for those of you who are on the fence about buying this game, i would wait. It is a bad pc port, almost without any work gone into it.  In short:   +Narrative and story seems good +Absolutely incredible soundtrack  -Can't bind extra mouse buttons to anything -Rear view mirror has terrible draw distance -30 fps cap -Really low res textures all over the place -Looks like upscaled graphics -Horrible shadow draw distance on some objects   This is what i can remember at the top of my head. This is not worthy of a triple A PC release. Even if the game was running at 60fps, this does not look like a PC game with this price tag. So wait until it's on at least 50% sale.  It saddens me a bit to say this, because i had hopes for this game, i added it to my wishlist last December. And was looking forward to enjoying this game for the next few weeks until civilization VI releases. If it wasn't for the steam refund system, i would have felt robbed right now.  TBH this game has issues i don't think they will fix anytime soon, there will be plenty of fanboys saying i'm wrong about this, that a fix is just around the corner. But i can't see it happening. Maybe a 60fps fix is coming within the next week or so, maybe 2 weeks. But that will still make the game look washed out.  This review might change completely if they do something drastic.    EDIT:   Thanks to user :  Butcher of Blaviken , i'm now adding some information to this review. After i wrote this review, 2K released another statement which reads:   We currently have a patch running here at the studio that includes 30, 60, and unlimited frames-per-second options in the video menu, among other improvements for the PC version of Mafia III. We re verifying the patch now to ensure everything is working as expected. If everything goes well, we expect the update to go live this weekend.     EDIT 2:   This game is much worse than i thought. I have seen a lot of videos today showing hundreds of serious bugs and glitches. From the looks of it, this game is far worse than watch_dogs was/is.  So now i have absolutely no hope left that this game will ever be fixed, if you want to see, just search for 'Let's Break the Mafia 3 AI' &amp; 'mafia 3 gameplay bugs', and stuff like that on google and youtube and a lot of videos will show you how bad this game really is.  So i just refunded it. This is totally unacceptable, and 2K should have known better. And i usually defend 2K as they release a lot of quality content. But this is the first title made by Hangar13, and i can safely say they were not up for the task.",-1,1

383870,Firewatch,"Firewatch is a game that sold itself to me primarily on the amazing aesthetics, and I ended up going into it almost entirely blind. This turned out to be a furtunate decision, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it over a bit less than 4 hours, having had few expectations going in. And for the first time in a long time, I did another playthrough of a game very shortly after finishing it (clocking in another 3 hours), in order to see what I had missed the first time around.  Briefly, Firewatch is a narrative game centering around two people, one of whom is the protagonist, Henry, who has taken the job to monitor for the presence of fires in the Shoshone National Forest, from atop a guard tower. The main gameplay element, and the major draw, is the radio that Henry carries during his duties, which connects him with the second major character, his supervisor Delilah. Delilah not only gives Henry tasks to complete, typically involving longer or short trips into the wilderness, but also grows to be a close and familiar presence to both Henry and the player, and their interactions form the backbone of the game. During their interactions, the player has the option of choosing between various responses, or even no response, shaping the narrative between the two. I found this aspect of the game to be incredibly well done, thanks to a great script and the fantastic voice acting performed for both characters. The game is further underlined by an incredible soundtrack, which I found to fit the story and the setting very well, and which makes for great listening on its own.  However, as the narrative is the backbone of the game, more gamey elements take a backseat. There are very minor puzzle elements, and some minor 'collectibles' which allow you to learn about some secondary characters, but these take the back-seat to the narrative between Henry and Delilah. Fortunately, I would argue, as the game would not have been any better in my eyes had it included an abundance of such elements. If I have to make one criticism, it would be that the game could have benefitted from a bit more time spent fleshing out the relationship between Delilah and Henry, before the plot gains steam.  Finally, while some were apparently disappointed by the ending, I will say that I am not among those. In fact, now that I know the full scope of the story, I was eager to play the game again, to reshape the narrative (in some ways) compared to my last play-through, and to see what hints, clues, and   turtles   I missed the first time around. Indeed, playing the game again provided answers to several questions that I had missed during my first playthrough, and revealed additional background information thanks to different dialogue choices, though I did find that this also revealed that certain parts of the conversation were not as flexible as I had hoped. Still, for me, both the game and the soundtrack was worth every cent, and worth playing through twice.   A final recommendation before I finish: By default the game will show your exact location on the map, and pop up notifications when your objective changes. It is, however, possible to turn both of these features off, and I would strongly urge anyone playing Firewatch to do so, as this makes for a much more immersive experience. Furthermore, I would also recommend playing with head-phones, to enhance the already great sound-design, both in terms of the environmental audio and the music.",1,0

321960,Might & Magic Heroes VII ,"I really wanted to like this game, I don't mind the slow AI, Even tough its at the same quality of Heroes 2 or 3.. the clunky animations or re used models. animation and modelling cost a lot of money to do, and Im guessing the game did not have a high budget. or all the money went into making a map maker that can make random 3d maps. I remember when heroes VI came out and they said they couldn't make a 3d map maker, it would be to dificult and to expensive, turns out they where right on the expensive part, as the game is severly lacking.   AI could be patched later, but the fact that so many champaign games have gamebreaking bugs in them, at launch is rediculus. Those are mostly fixed now, but what really breakes it for me is the out of sync errors on multiplayer, even over a LAN network whitout simultainius turns and whitout spectateing combats I can never get a game to last longer then 2 weeks if im LUCKY.   I like the new flanking mechanics, but I dont like the change to warcries, or the fact that you can't make a custom hero anymore like you could in VI. That was cool.  its been a month, some of the gamebreaking single player bugs have been fixed, but there is still some memory leaking bugs and the out of syncadge making it unplayable.

29900,Dark Sector,"Difficult (almost no modern hand-holding and no difficulty adjustment), a little scary, and full of mystery, Dark Sector is a brutal 3rd-person shooter with a twist... your character (Hayden Tenno) is slowly being transformed into a monster by a strange alien virus. The more of a 'monster' you become, the more 'human' you become (well, despite all the brutality he must partake in to survive). Tenno also gets to use an awesome pinwheel of death that grows out of his hand, blatantly ripped off of the cult 80's sci-fi/fantasy film 'Krull', name and all (the 'Glaive'). Graphics are great, soundtrack is a bit repetitive but great, Tenno's powers become more awesome as you progress, and the whole affair serves as a prequel of sorts to 'Warframe' (I played Dark Sector first, way back in 2007 on my Xbox 360, so I was drooling over Warframe when it first came out on PC). What's not to like? Er, other than the aspect ratio being a little screwy on widescreen resolutions.",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"Don't give Sean Murray your money. The game is Minecraft alpha with a nice texture pack. Buy Minecraft instead.   The beginning is simple enough. Fix your ship, power it up, explore the skies. And then the problems arise. There is no real objective and the 12983709817243987234 planets they could create are boring. creatures are scarce, resources are limited and inventory is ALWAYS a problem. some things stack for convenience, other don't jsut to annoy you. You can't automate obvious and essential tasks, such as powering up your environmental suit. So every 30 mins ro so, you will open your inventory, scroll throughy our mods to your survival module, and feed it carbon or some other element you have thousands of. But that's it. Name things, learn languages (3), and explore.   Very, very seriously, buy minecraft. not NMS. it's overpriced, it's barren, it doesn't have multiplayer, it fails to revolutionize anything and fails to even work out basic elements properly.

245620,Tropico 5,"Hey - crapola alert! - its a great game and all that - but, I just feel like I've wasted my time in the game. 2.9 hours wasted..   I started in tutorial mode and was enjoying my game, I had plantations for every crop, had built a catholic mission as soon as I could and had 5 military towers and a military base. I was even sending out troops on recon missions.  Looking forward to opening up the rest of the game, I already had tenaments and houses opened and had built several tenaments and mansions and houses. I had a second mine going, a clinic, casino, two restaurantes, tobacco and textile factory, Two lumber mills and two logging production units, parks and whole load of housing built as well as a police station and fishing dock. I had a power plant and was sending out experdition to get the ancient ruins discovered.  Then I was amazed to get warings in the tutorial about trades notices and other edicts. When my game came back into play, I had lost everything - I have the save to prove it, but each time I load it, - the tutorial interrupts my game.   I just wish they had told me this would happen at the start. If you know how to play this game as do I, my advice would be to start in normal mode- not tutorial mode.   I am now really dismayed at the thought of having to do all that again - it has just spoilt my enjoyment of the game.   Damn the Tropico devs for not letting you continue your game to normal play after starting in the tutorial mode. I don't think I have the energy to contiue playing. Really peed off.   It will be some time and I will have to be bored s*** less before I decide to waste any more of my life and leisure time on this game.",-1,0

For example, complete the game without buying anything in the shop, or visit both secret locations in one run and then complete the game. Makes for quite a challenge.

412540,The Minotaur," Thank you to the developers for generously supplying me with a review key.  ---    The Minotaur  is a small puzzle-solving coffee break game, with the added bonus of local couch play.  While there are a few different modes such as endless and time-attack, the fairly simple puzzle solving mechanic does not change drastically throughout.  Essentially, you push blocks in order to 'squish' or 'entrap' minotaurs.  The minotaurs have a few variants, but could definately use more.   Pros:  +Music and artwork is very nice +Navigating the menus in-game with the character always works out well IMO +While the modes do not differ greatly, they give options +Multiplayer works great, with solid controller support   Cons:  -As I am playing this, I often wonder if it would have been better off being strictly turn-based (ie. I move 1 turn, and then the minotaurs get 1 turn, repeat). As it stands, the minotaurs move in real-time, which leaves me thinking less and making hasty moves. Would more strategy be good here? -The base mechanic is fine, but definately not enough to get me addicted. Its been done one-too-many times before. -Powerups scattered on the board would surely add entertainment value. Having players scramble for things that make the game easier or harder would be great.  -Surely something that could be fixed - sometimes you spawn with an enemy literally right next to you and its insta-death. No big deal, since death doesn't mean much, but this should be fixed. -I find trying to achieve a certain score to be fairly boring and meaningless. Maybe give me meta-game unlocks? How about character color/skin customization?   Look, this is not a fail by any means. I mean this is a great start for this developement team. As I always ask: would I recommend it to my friends to run out and spend their hard-earned money? No.  I'd keep this developement team on my radar, because there is real potential - and they have shown that they can deliver a final, stable, product. Best of luck to them with this, and future work.",-1,1

Now, let's get this clear, If you're a minecraft player and you're expecting a minecraft game but 2D You will most likely hate this game. If you're a person who likes Exploring and going to a boss and getting your ♥♥♥ whupped and then working to get stronger and stronger then going to that boss and shoving his hand straight up his ♥♥♥ with Crafting elements that pretty much follow Minecraft's Console crafting, You will love the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. [No spoilers for players who haven't played]  Pros  Game's pretty simple to start out with, easy for newer players to get into it.  The game is constantly updating so any game-breaking bug will probably be fixed within the week and is also still getting lots of new stuff.  The worlds are randomly generated so, it literally is impossible to have 2 worlds that have the exact same biomes in the exact same places.  There's good Co-op with friends and works very solidly, so playing with friends is awwweeesssooooome.  Bosses are very challenging and if you don't come prepared, you will die. A lot.  Every boss is very different both in how it is summoned and how it is fought.  Every ENEMY is very different in which there are Zombies which are slow enemies who can and Will attack you at anytime he see's you while there are some more enemies like the Floating Eye which will take a good angle you can't see it from and rush you to deal quite a bit of damage and there's enough variance in all enemies they never get boring to look at.  The game has Tons of replayability.  The game encourages you to go mining and exploring, in fact there are many bosses that are only found by exploring the world around you.  Cons:  The community isn't exactly the most perfect thing, and most of the time it's best just playing with a group of friends.  There is a lot of work to get from the early stages to the game to the full experience, Before you kill a certain boss you are in pretty much the tutorial world and you can get stuck.  If you're new, the wiki will be a Nessisary.  There are many items, but also very complicated to craft and at times can be a burden to get everything.  Most of the time, private servers will require another program such as Hamachii  Overall BUY THIS GAME. Even if you're a minecraft player who thinks you won't like this, wait till a sale and buy it because it's worth it.  I give this game a 9.0/10  (I'll be putting out more reviews and you'll notice, it's hard to punch an 8 out of me if it isn't something I don't think is worth it.)  This game is awesome and it's pretty cheap for all it has. I highly reccomend this game and will gladly tell anyone to buy this. While this game is pretty amazing, it also has some very small faults and can get annoying, Achievements are coming in tomorrow so it may make some of the con's a bit less confusing.  If the game wanted to be a full 10.0/10 making the crafting a bit less complicated would help a lot, like being able to look at an item and see what it makes and having a built in invite only world option or something like that.

369070,Slain: Back from Hell,"I had this title on my wishlist for quite a while. I just thought that the artwork looked so awesome and it seemed to have a good soundtrack too.   The combat seems to be just what I expected too. Simple, yet you REALLY can't just run at a horde of enemies and try to kill them.   And unlike some people reviewing I've had absolutely no problems with the controls using an Xbox One controller.   What I too would like to see, is a meter that showed how many times I've been SLAIN! If you DON'T like to be killed in a game, then I probably wouldn't recommend this ;)  All in all, 12,99€ (11,69€ on launch) really isn't that much money and I believe I got my money's worth with this game.",1,0
306130,The Elder Scrolls Online,"When your in your mid 20's and you feel like you've played every MMO the internet has the offer, everything kind of feels stale.. at some points you don't even play the damn game, you just download it for 5 hours, skim through the character creation, a quest or two and never log in again. I can guarantee anyone who has played WoW as a kid can remember the feeling of awe and feeling of adventure when you first logged in.. The sense of community, the sense of being in ANOTHER world, immersiveness, etc. Of course overtime as new games come out and new expectations are made - you look back at a game like WoW now and that sense of adventure is almost non existant.  (Not a WoW bash, I used to love the game religiously)  BUT NOW WE HAVE ESO! BOYS N GIRLS LEMME TELL YA, THIS ♥♥♥♥ IS AMAZING!  GAMEPLAY/INTERFACE 8.5/10 The one thing I hated about MMO's, was once you reached max level - you had a ♥♥♥♥ load of macros to set up and a whole lot of spells/abilities to cater for. With ESO, even though it has been simplified in a way that you won't get confused - all passive &amp; active abilities can be tuned to how you want to play. The character customization can let you build a Battlemage Warrior to a Tanked out Rogue. (Think classes from Oblivion, that's what they've done here, and WELL!) All combinations of abilities, class, weapon and armor type can all be tailored to how you play, but still be viable in a dungeon group or a game of PvP. The smoothness transition in combat is one to die for in MMO's these days, you'll just have fun killing mobs like you would in a game of Skyrim, having a very similar hack and slack style mechanic. The game's interface is fluid and well taken care of, also comparable to the menu settings in Skyrim.  The following class types are: Dragonknight, Templar, Nightblade &amp; Sorcerer Weapon types: 1h, 2h, 1h + Shield, Dual Wield, Bow, Destruction Staff &amp; Restoration Staff Followed by all of your favourite playable races!  Now everything from your race, class, weapon type and even crafting proficiency will provide your character with different stats, abilities &amp; way of playing, so have fun! Don't settle down for your first character, give em all a shot and see what fits you!   Walking around with my increased stealth stats lets me wander around city to city, scavenging through boxes and chests undetected (Yes, they have the pick lock systems just like the other games) to get cooking supplies, which I then make into high level foods and drinks which sell for high on the AH. Steal your ingredients, make more money! Or just even be a full time thief and take it back to the Thieves guild fence for a bit of coin..  The sense of immersion I get from this game, it can sometimes feel like a singleplayer rpg. Communicating with NPC's and ACTUALLY listening to the quest storyline is actually.. fun.. which is something that's usually skipped over in most MMO's. The immense amount of lore and nostalgic references from the old games leaves plenty to the imagination, especially if you're the roleplay type.   The auction trading service is amazing - It all starts with guilds out bidding each other on NPC vendors who control spots in various places to sell their guild items to the public. If you and your guild scrap up enough gold, you can outbuy other guild traders and take their spots, enabling your guild to auction of items, lots of fun!    AUDIO 7/10 The only reason I didn't give this a higher score is because some of the music is straight out of Skyrim, but other then that - the actual music they have created for the game and the general audio of the game is beautiful. No complaints   VIDEO 8.5/10 Visually stunning, breath-taking and probably the most graphically immersive MMORPG on the market, in my honest opinion. If you have a decent computer that can run this at high settings, half the time you'll probably just stand around looking at sh*t coz how pretty it is.   COMMUNITY (VARIES, CURRENT SCORE 6.5/7 out of 10) I've played this on PS4, PC and XBOX One.  The community on PS4 bloody brilliant, I participated in an all Orc roleplay guild who would run through cities screaming 'FOR MALACATH!' on their mics. We all wore the same armor and ran through making a name for ourself. Because the only way to communicate on consoles was with a microphone, you could walk into a main city and just start talking with people like if you walked into a cafe in real life.. Not so much with the PC version, but the sense of immersion and community vibe is still there. It's a type of community I miss in MMO Games.   PVP 7/10 PVP is huge ♥♥♥ battlegrounds designed for big army warfare. Imagine playing a game of Age of Empires but instead of controlling the whole army, you just control your one dude. You could have 20 players attacking the south side of map taking over a castle, while another 20 or on the north side taking over a farm - and they're a good 30min walking distance from each other. THINK HUGE There is also dueling implented as of recently, really nicely balanced!  PVE 8/10 No complaints, it feels like a singpleplayer game half the time and just feels awesome when you run into a bunch of players doing the same quest as you. Great dungeons, great loot, a good rewarding feeling after every quest. Everything has been scaled recently, so now that old places you have outleveled months ago will be a challenge again, leaving low level places still worth adventuring for treasure.  CRAFTING 9/10 Oh man, crafting is my favoutite in this game, it feels rewarding as hell. Most of the best items created in the game is through crafting, there are unique designs from Daedric, Dwarven, Orcish, Argonian armor designs etc. It's straight forward and easy to grasp for even the most beginner player. No complaints  CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION 8/10 You're going to spend a lot of time before even logging in, just working on your dudes nose.. trust me. You can customize your armor color (Colors unlock depending on ingame achievements) Classes aren't bound to armor types, so go ahead and be a heavy armor rockin' mage if you like!   THERE'S PROBABLY SO MUCH I'M MISSING BUT YEAH, GET THE GAME! ITS FUN!  ",1,1

Its a very chilled out game, but in now way makes you take a backseat as a player. The combat is more annoying than enjoyable, but luckely can be completely avoided. The logistics element really takes some getting used to, and can become really conveluted.

620,Portal 2,"This has got to be one of the most fun, most rewarding and entertaining experiences I have had in a game. First I simply played the single-player and enjoyed it a lot, felt I received my moneys worth. But after playing a bit of coop with my sister I just felt inspired to get around and write a review. So where to begin? Perhaps gameplay. It takes a gimmick, shooting portals to travel, manipulate stuff and ultimately solve puzzles. Portal 2 runs with the gimmick and, in true Valve-style, creates puzzles which feel more rewarding and organic than typical videogame puzzles, where it usually feels like you are trying to mind-read a cryptic all-powerful creature, a creature which tries its best to mask what it wants from you, which punishes every experimentation and failure harshly and without even giving you a clue of where you went wrong. Instead, Portal does things like Half-Life 2 did (I touched upon it in my  HL2 review here ), there´s more of a sense of observing, putting things together without too much arbitrary design choices and rules which never seem to stay consistent and trustworthy. Portal 1 and 2 has some arbitrary things like portals firing upon white surfaces, but it makes this clear and stick with this rule, it creates an environment where learning the rules is not useless, but you keep adding them up lawfully, like a scientist exploring how the game universe operates. It´s fun to figure puzzles out, rewarding, and you can incrementally add up the steps, instead of having to hold in mind a complicated maze and then have to succeed on your first try or start from scratch. I mean, you can and have to strategize, but it can be done in parts, and it is more organic, than feeling gamey, like having to remember the way to put some tilepuzzles together from some scrap of a picture you caught a glimpse of earlier in the game. The Single-Player story was fun, the pacing, telling, the little details you can pay attention to or run past are immersive. I could go on, but many of the strengths of Valve games are here in Portal 2, so what I´ve said about HL2 applies, in the style of relying on atmosphere, environments and observation, coupled with narration. It was a well rounded satisfying experience. I´ll admit it´s now some months since I played SP so I can´t go to more details, but my impression is still very positive. I still have a general idea of the actual substance of the story, it was a bit whacky at times, a scifi story with comedic twists and turns, but it was still told well and had the content was enjoyable, even Wheatley for me, though I´ve heard some were annoyed by that character. But the coop has been utterly fabulous. From the simple way to invite friends and jump into the game, the joy of figuring things out and the game giving the tools to allow you to communicate effectively (mic obviously a tool available), with pings with options to point out where to stand, what to look at, how to interact with, the remote view which allows you to see things from your friends perspective, and just the dynamic, organic humour of flying around portals, messing around, gesturing in a silly way, taunting Glados-- I haven´t played it yet fully, but I expect many more similarly enjoyable rich hours. There´s some story in there as well, it feels like Valve wanted the coop to be rich enough to stand equally strong on the SP campaign side. Some even like the coop more than SP, and I´m starting to see why. As a source engine, the game looks beautiful, plays solidly with little problems, bugs or performance issues, and is a great open engine allowing tweaks and mods. The game has Workshop and will possibly add even more fun to play, both SP and coop. If I were someone to give scores, my initial playthrough would have been a solid lovely 8-9/10, but now after starting to fool around with coop, this is simply 10+ out of ten for me.",1,0

232430,Gone Home,"Gone Home thrusts you into the body of Katie Greenbriar, an annoyingly generic college-goer who has returned to her family's vacant abode for a visit. As Katie, you can spend much of your time barricading the downstairs toilet with every movable item on the first floor and proceed to also fill up the various empty pizza boxes with non-consumable items, including a lone condom and at least a billion copies of her father's moronic novel.  Aside from offering the ability to stack and unstack household objects for literally hours, the game does provide a realistic, moderately gripping love story revealed by, obviously, displacing more objects.   The voice acting is believable and definitely an integral strength, and the inclusion of playable feminist punk tapes throughout the home gives the game some needed spice. Additionally, both Sam and Lonnie are likable characters with a tendency to be cute and clever in their notes to each other.   Despite the enjoyment I derived from playing this, I wouldn't recommend paying full price. I think if I had not purchased it for $2.99 during a flash sale, at the end of the game I would've been too distracted by my discontentment over squandering $20 to appreciate the notable qualities.",1,0

283880,Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok,"Wow! There is not a better value on Steam. If you grew up on the old Sierra adventure games like Quest for Glory, King's Quest, Police Quest, Conquests of the Longbow, or Space Quest, then you can easily spend 30+ hours playing this game. I've not even completed the game once, yet, and I'm having a blast. This is truly a spiritual successor to the Quest for Glory series, unlike Quest for Glory V. Think of this game as the Quest for Glory V that should have been. I'll give an explanation as to what I mean.  If you played QFG3 and QFG4 (or the VGA remakes of QFG1 and QFG2), then you're familiar with the QFG format. It's a point and click adventure game with an RPG style of character development. You get a character sheet in the beginning and spend some 'free points' in different skills and attributes. Then, you're dropped in the world to quest. As you use skills, they level up. All of the QFG games followed this format, but QFG5 changed the interface in a major way. It was the first '3D' QFG game. The character could be controlled with a turret-style control scheme, and combat wasn't compartmentalized the way it had been before. So, the game felt very clumsy overall and didn't have the same feeling as the previous four titles. This game brings everything about the QFG style of game right back where it belongs.  The game starts by having you select one of three classes, just like QFG. The classes are essentially the same as the Fighter, Magic User, and Thief from QFG. There isn't a Paladin class in this series, but there is an honor mechanic which could possibly imply a Paladin class in a sequel (PRETTY PLEASE LET THERE BE A SEQUEL!!!). You then are able to distribute 50 points across your character sheet. Your character will solve in-game problems in different ways based on your skills. A Warrior might ram a door down. A Rogue may pick the lock. A Wizard may blast it or cast an Open spell. And, these might not be the only options depending on the exact situation. Maybe you just knock and trick the guy on the other side to open it so you can club him on the head. There are skills for all of these actions, so you need to pay attention to your skill set when you make your character.  Once the game starts, you find yourself in a harsh, winter environment. You're broke. You have 15 coins, and a decent meal at another nearby town costs 8 coins. You can't stay outside too long without freezing to death, and the weather is constantly sapping your stamina. Along the way, you'll find ways to secure food and battle the cold, but life is hard at first. You also don't have your equipment. You have your weapon and some basic items, but you will be missing your gear pack due to the opening events of the game. You'll meet the townsfolk, find ways to feed yourself, pick up quests, and get some leads on where to find your gear. From there, it's up to you, really. You could choose to immediately start doing quests to get some income and items. You could opt to hunt monsters and train up your skills for a few days. You could try and explore the map first. The game world is yours.  Part of the beauty of the this game, just like the QFG games, is the humor embedded in every environment. Something as simple as looking at a tree reveals a pun or some quirky quip. Character dialogues are laced with references to your favorite Sierra games, phrases like 'So, you want to be a Hero?' Too many jokes to count exist in this game, and part of the replay value is finding them all. I'm not even to the second map, yet, and I'm still uncovering things to chuckle at just around the two towns. Occasionally, I smack my forehead, like when I found the gravestone that said, 'Here lies Cedric Diggery. Entered a graveyard alive. Left dead.'   This is truly a gem. You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't have it in your library. Download it and play it. If you're new to the genre, be patient with it for an hour or so. Not many games follow the same sort of RPG development as these games did, and most aren't as unforgiving. When games like this one tell you you're tired, you'd better find someplace safe to sleep! Fail to do so and you'll collapse and die where you're standing and be devoured by the creatures of the night. Climb a tree without a sufficient enough climb skill and you may just fall out and break your neck. Take some time to figure it out, and you'll be in for one the most treasured types of gaming experiences in gaming history. There's a green button up there. Press it.",1,0

I highly recommend this game to any MGS series fan, the story is not as bad as everyone is saying it is, the gameplay is amazing with few downsides here and there but they're avoidable, and the optimization of this game on PC is incredible.

I think one thing they did really well was they took actual events and places that happened and then spun them to where it wasnt just replaying history so that was definitley a plus to me. Overall I'd say 7/10  Also get the DLC you'll get to shoot Hitler in the ♥♥♥♥",1,0

239350,Spelunky,"What starts off as an unforgiving and somewhat brutal platformer, Spelunky blossoms into a richly deep and satisfying game which rewards patience and strategy. It definitely takes quite a number of hours of play before you can get far, but once you do you will be absolutely hooked.  As a rogue-lite platformer, each game is randomised and death is never too far away, as you only start off with 3 health.  Decisions you make in the game are often trading off risk vs reward. Much of the game is optional, as getting to the exit of each level, if done directly, is quite easy. The trick is when to know to venture from the beaten path, and how to take on various enemies to score loots.  Recommended that after a few hours of play to check out the wiki, but even at almost 20 hours I find I'm still discovering subtle mechanics and new strategies.",1,0

Gives rise to some SERIOUS existential thinking, it's absolutely beautiful to look at and challenging to even long term fans of the puzzle genre. The story is lightweight in the way it's presented to you (it's not forced down your throat, and you could pretty much ignore it if you really wanted to) but is compelling and has several times during the game very much moved me Absolutely the only downside is that the puzzles have only a few mechanics, but even this is overcome by the way in which the level design is put together - what you thought you knew from that puzzle a few levels ago is pretty much the same in this one, but disguised in such a way that its hard to tell you've only recently done pretty much the same thing.  Demo doesn't have any story hooks, but shows the gameplay well - I bought the game based off this alone and I regret not one single penny!",1,0

So much so that I am still learning tactics 8 hours in (at the time of this review). Its very addictive.  Positives that I haven't seen mentioned much: - You can attack as fast as you can press a fire button/key (10 rocket launcher rockets per second, no problem) and it doesnt break the game mechanics. - Good combination/balance of weapons that initially seem arbitrary but all have their use once you run through a couple dozen times.  Some negatives: - The graphics are going to turn people away. - I wish there was a way to quick select a weapon rather than scrolling through them all  Tip: - for later levels always stealth before entering a new room and keep stealth up while exploring a room.

274270,NOT A HERO,"Not A Hero is an interesting game involving fever pitch combat mixed with nonsensical but on target humor where you do things that are fitting of the title.  Basically, run through identical buildings with different layouts, shoot lots of baddies, be awesome, die a lot. Simple.   Death comes fast (towards you and your foes) but most of the time the levels are short enough that a single death won't put you back too much. The longest of the 25 levels is about 4 or 5 minutes even if you're rushing through, and a lot of these happen towards the end of your heroic murderspree. Which is an aggrivating issue especially when you reach a point where some enemies can one hit kill you.  That said, the game is very well balanced. Each of the nine playable characters are unique and have enough quirks between them to justify playing starter characters even in later levels. Each level of the game highlights what our cast can do well whether it be attack enemies from both sides, move fast, execute silently, or more. Of course the later characters are more powerful, though they end up surrendering the use of powerup equipment in the process (which honestly isn't too big of a loss).   Not A Hero is a lot of fun to play from beginning to end, despite the aggrivation involving deaths. It's got some awesome varied voice acting too which helps with the constant dying thing. It is a twitch sidescolling shooter though so if you don't have the reflexes or the quick wit you best find something else as the game only gets faster. If you think you're up for the slaughter, then pick up this game whenever you feel like it - on sale or full retail. Hopefully there'll be a rad sequel.",1,0
497180,Street Legal Racing: Redline v2.3.1,"One of the best street racing games ever made!  Build up your car, cruise around, race some folks, run from the cops, smash your brand new car, rinse and repeat. I have spent countless hours on this game as a kid and it's STILL one of the best games I've ever played. Don't get me wrong...the physics kinda suck and the game itself is buggy as hell. But it's still an amazing simulation of what street racing is. Being able to build up the entire motor, suspension and body. Tuning specific parts to change how the car behaves. This game taught me what tires couldn't fit on my car, what spring rates and timing was. Mixtures of Gearhead Garage and NFS:U.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this game. I promise that if you are into cars in the slightest (building them), then this game is definitely for you! Now that it's on Steam, and the Workshop is coming, I think Street Legal Racing could make an epic comeback. Join us and help bring back this gem!",1,0
290770,The Fall,"Pretty short but increidibly interesting. Awesome character development with the protagonist and the antagonist is a different but fantastic villain. A bit pricey for how short it is though. The atmosphere provides enough creepy aura to make the game have that horror game feel without actually being a horror game. The puzzles are pretty difficult at some points and have that 'where do I go what do I do' helpless feeling which might be my only negative view of the game. However figuring out the puzzles after that frustration factor sets in is incredibly rewarding and makes you feel good about yourself. All in all I'd give it an 8.5/10, the only thing docking it points being the length of the game and the mediocre conveyance with the puzzles.",1,0

But the cons really aren't enough to make it not worth playing.  ==PROS== - First off, it's FREE! And the things in game you do pay for are all aesthetic. So there is no Pay-to-win here. - LOOT!! Loads of loot that is satisfying to find - It looks fantastic! Lot's of gore too - The passive skill tree is amazing - Heaps of nostalgic feelings. If you loved Diablo 2, then play this! - The new potion system is somewhere between classic potions and health globes. But the ability to find 'magic' potions makes it fantastic - Skill gems are weird, but it's grown on me - The corpses of monsters staying piled up is gruesome and satisfying  ==CONS= - Some of the animations are funky. Running looks odd. And there isn't always a lot of oomph to attacking - Can sometimes be lag, where hit's take a second to register (not often though) - I like the removal of gold, but sometimes the bartering system can be super annoying - I wish there were more acheivements.

It has an extremely steep learning curve and until you get your hands on some weapons and some money it's extremely difficult (even on easy!) but once you get going there's a really well made FPS here with some great RPG elements, good level design and an entertaining story. It's showing its age but is a far cry from the by the books, cover shooter FPS games we see today. Well worth persisting with.",1,1

The goal is mainly just to stop the divers, and S.T.E.V.E has an extremely high health considering I've just been battering him for the past half hour. And then as divers, it seems very difficult to control them; I often end upside down. However, I'll reccomend this game, for two reasons. 1) It's well built, I haven't discovered any bugs and the overall experience matches the genre it's listed under. Because of this, I believe that issues such as the ones listed above may be smoothed over and rectified. The second reason, honestly, I ♥♥♥♥ my pants playing as a diver.",1,0

379720,DOOM,"I would highly recommend this game for the single player but I wouldn't recommend it for the multiplayer.  Multiplayer : The fast paced action dodging projectiles is part of the franchises core. But in multiplayer they have the weapons that instantly do damage and then the weapons that take time to travel before they cause damage. The issue is that a good majority of the players use the shotgun, chain gun or static rifle(sniper). So if you choose to use the pulse rifle you are at an immediate disadvantage because you can not dodge their shots but they can dodge your shots. When you are getting hit the sound that you are being hit is pretty subtle, sometimes I don't even realize that I'm being hit from behind until I'm already dead. This is using headphones as well(Sennheiser HD 598) to be specific. Lastly is the armor pick ups. If you spawn and you come across another player that has been a live for a while and has full armor you are at an immediate disadvantage even though you just spawned.  Single player : This still stays true to the franchises root but also isn't afraid to be it's own game. There is still locked doors with keys that are colored to let you know what door that you unlock with the key. The enemies are either have ranged attacks that travel over time or are melee enemies. Some enemies that have ranged attacks will try and come to melee you as well. There is lots of secrets, you get around 10 weapons with weapon mods to play with and you get to upgrade your health/armor/ammo supplies as you go through the campaign.  The hardest difficulty is by far my favorite to play. When you die you have to restart the entire campaign over and the enemies are very challenging. There is also an easter egg in the game which has the original Dooms sprites and music in it which is a awesome tribute to remembering the original Doom video games.",1,0

The story is short and sweet, but very underwhelming; I saw the ending coming before I even played the game. I will say that everything feels natural, if only it wasn't so predictable.  The visuals are a treat to the eyes, and the soundtrack is beautiful; however, this game is more about the experience of you playing it, but the problem is that there's not much the game offers to experience.

The story while not ground breaking, has an original flair to it managing to mix in some dark humor in it's seemly childlike charm.  The game with the DLC is a total of around 8 hours for 100% completion, and I have to say the game is worth full price for it's entertainment value.

32450,LEGO® Indiana Jones™ 2: The Adventure Continues,"Similar to the movie, 'LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues' doesn't compare to the original Lego Indy game, BUT it does seem to hold on it's own quite well.   I would not call this game 'short' in any way, but does feel easier than the original, mostly because of lack of collectibles and an increased number of minigame-type stages. Some say this may be better because it allows for more of a free-roam experience, but it led to confusion at times when searching the overworlds for certain stages. Plus it's required that you know what character are needed for each level, if you one that is equipped with the wrong item, you have to go back to the overworld, grab a character that fulfills the required item (eg. shovel, whip, bazooka) and only then can you advance.  Overall I would give this a 7/10. Again, I can't be too critical as this game is meant for kids, but it does seem significantly easier than previous installments in the LEGO game series. Maybe just completing the story you may find it a little lackluster, but with that being said, I did have quite fun completing it too 100% and suggest anyone pick this up if it ever goes on sale. Usually Lego game are at a consistent $20 which, in my opinion, is pretty steep, BUT if you ever find it at 50%-75%, it really is worth it.",1,0
225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,"This is a fun game with some great puzzles and story. It can be beaten quickly, and it doesn't have very much replayability, but I strongly reccomend it for people who like to do playthroughs on youtube or like story-driven games. The games story is easy to understand, but I won't spoil it. Due to the fact that the people in the game speak a made up language, you have to really just guess what it is. The conrols are easy to learn, but hard master. Basically how it works is the left side of the controller controls the older brother, and the right side of the controller controls the younger brother. This does make it hard at times when they start to move to seperate sides of the screen, which makes the controls cofusing, and you will probably die. Finally, the graphics and music are both BEAUTIFUL, but you need a really good computer to handle them without too much lag. Brothers: a Tale of Two Sons gets a 9/10",1,0

570,Dota 2,"4000 hours of dota. Jettisoned in the trash by update 7.00  - UI is very uncomfortable. - Stat mechanism could do, but is so HotS-ish... - New hero unbalanced that just comes out from LoL and lands into DotA. - 6 runes is so dumb.  - THE MOST GAMEBREAKING FEATURE: THE MAP The map is now dispersive, full of high and low ground that aren't needed. Sanctuaries are gamebreaking for healing but more importantly for tp-ing on them. Bushes are full of holes, this is so LoL-ish... This map is totally ruined.  I could have adapted to any changes they made... EXCEPT the MAP. I feel every minute: lost, out of position, gankable, with an anxiety about also new creep camps to stack (i play support), new runes, i was ready for TI with the older map, now i feel like a baby that can barely walk...

17460,Mass Effect (2007),"Only word I can think of to accurately describe Mass Effect is 'epic'. Definitely one of the richest RPG's I've played in terms of story and character interaction. Whole thing plays like a really good Sci-Fi movie, much better in fact than the tripe they're passing off as Sci-Fi these days (I'm looking at you, Skyline).  Combat is pretty fun, inventory management is...better in the second game, but it's hardly bad in ME1, just not ideal. The last hour and a half of play in the game is far too epic to go into, all I will say is that it moved me :D  For how cheap it is now, you can't really afford NOT to buy it, hours of entertainment for pennies!  8.5/10",1,0

Nights don't move anything like pawns. Also, it's full of so many STOP, you can't do that, ding dong alerts that it's infuriating. I know how to play chess, I've been playing sense I could walk, which is longer than mostly of you reading this have probably been alive. I don't need so many alerts and downright aggressively toned lock ups.   There's more problems after the so called bug fixes than there was before  ",-1,0

The customization is grand, not as grand as in sr2 even with it's older graphics, but there is enough of a variety that my three (so far) gang leaders have looked completly differnet from each other.

Lots of great character races and classes to choose from with no restrictions on combos, Wanna make a halfling barbarian with almost no strength? go right ahead....  Graphics are very very good considering the age of the engine and a extreme amount of detail has gone into the individual player avatars. (dont expect 2015 level AAA graphics)  The story is as twisting and turning as you would expect from thse developers and the moral choices are really good at making you sweat. (Do you want to better learn about your [secret mystery spoiler] by sacrificing some poor villagers to zombies?)  the difficulty is good. Dont expect to wander through the first few areas simply attacking spawns and clearing out each zone as you go...that will quickly lead to a party wipe.. You need to assess if each situation is worth fighting or if you should simply sneak past and come back with help?  All in all an excellent game that makes excellent use of an older game engine.

7940,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,"I first reviewed this game on 12/11/2011 and I had praised it as fun, low cost, and surprisingly active for a much older game. I didn't think much of it at the time other than a generally good game. Boy, I had no idea.  It is now 2016 and the game is almost a decade old. Since then, my opinon of COD4 has actually gone up. Not only is it the oldest game that I still play regularly beating out even newer games I've purchased, but it is still 'surprisingly active'.  Every single multiplayer mode still has at least one or two active servers. More popular modes like FFA and TDM, of course, has tons of active server. I'm still playing FFA/TDM with upwards of 20+ players at all times of the day. A decade old game!  Even better, multiplayer has some mods that people use and my favorite has come to be 'Reign of the Undead' (ROTU) -- a zombie mod which is unbelievably fun and also very active with many servers containing 5+ players regularly (and some as high as 10+). Sounds small compare to the main MP modes, but you really don't want more for ROTU.  Overall, COD4 has turned out to be an incredible value. I wouldn't have regretted this purchase had I paid full $60 price, but instead, I only got it for $20. Frankly, I got a steal for a game that I've been playing for so long and still intend to keep playing.",1,0

It's a reflex game where you navigate your cursor around plain, spinning rectangles, with barely anything you can call graphics, and little to no gameplay. Achievements slapped onto this game also have no subsance, just like the game itself. Other than the standard 'complete the level' achievements (which mean getting to the 5th score multiplier on every difficulty level, after which it just stops and stays forever on the fifth one, which is also one of the reasons it feels like an unfinished product, but I digress) there is nothing more that either tedious busywork (dying 1000 times, or collecting 100 of the rarely appearing power-ups, speaking of which, other than the invincibility one, they don't even matter) or just impossible (getting 10 million points which, depending on the difficulty level, would force you to stay alive for around 1,5 to 3 hours... but no one is actually sure, since the game doesn't give you any feedback to how many points you actually get, and even the developer is not completely sure as to how the game calculates that.)

381210,Dead by Daylight,"UPDATED REVIEW The game is a 4v1 survival/hunting game. Basically you can be The Killer or The Survivors. There are 5 different killers with 5 different ways to play them. Trapper - traps, Hillbilly - instantly incaps, Wraith - cloaks, ♥♥♥♥ - I mean Nurse - teleports, and Shape - stalks/instatly incaps. The goal is to sacrifice or kill all the survivors before they can escape. As for the Survivors. There 6 different survivors with 6 different characteristics. There is Dwight - supports/boosts, Claudette - supports/healer, Meg - agility/adredaline, Jake - sabotage/calm, Nea -stealth/agility, and Laurie - spotter/baiter. There goal is to activate the remaining generators to open the escape gate. They also have to rely on teamwork. And hide from the killer. In my previous review I said how there was no teamchat. Well they added a chat in lobby and after the game ends. So you can do some preplanning with teammates. Otherwise use Teamspeak or something. I also complained about servers. They have improved them working a lot better. (9/10) ORINGIAL REVIEW The game play is great. Extremely fun and intense at moments. Though there is no team chat which results in a lack of teamwork. Sadly I find myself carrying the game. Another side note to consider is that the servers are absolute crap. Half the time the servers disconnected or steam just goes down. Really kills the fun. I'd give it a 6/10 until some changes are made. Please release an update soon.",1,0

Edit 1:  Though the resolution issue has been corrected, the lag still remains. My laptop is able to run games that are more hardware demanding than this one. The only reason that I can think of, on the surface, of why there is such lag is due to the lack of support with integrated graphics. It's that or a condition is not being met in code that would correct the issue and not cause other issues on the other platforms. Again, this is surface/speculative thoughts. The Telltale team is full of tallented men and women. They know their product and are no doubt correcting the issue further. So lets hang in there.  Edit 2:  Not sure what the second update corrected, but it must have been small given the time it took to download was only a few seconds.

There isn't a cool new thing to learn, there is only the next building on the checklist. The buildings lack a lot of flavor and looks very ugly. A building called the launch pad for example, is just a box with a box roof and a little rocket inside. There are no resources, you just build a building and it automatically produces resources for the next tier of buildings. The buildings require maintenance and sometimes the maintenance workers get stuck trying to get to the building to repair it. Luckily they just start repairing from where they are, but only after a significant amount of time has passed. The building area is in a crater, which is neat, but the actual building area is square which looks terrible once you start getting more buildings out.",-1,0

250620,Among the Sleep,"First, the bad: its short. Even with the free DLC extra chapter, its short... like under 4 hours short. There is not a ton of replay value unless you get drawn into the story and want to go back to see little meta-clues and child-drawings you missed. The couple of graphical glitches, overlapping lighting through doors, odd seeing through objects at odd angles... not bad honestly, and definitely not game-breaking.  The good: this is a rather well told dark story, and seeing it explored through the body of a 2-yr old child is a very unique approach to telling it. Your adult-brain logic being used to guide the character through the puzzles and tale aside, they've done quite a good job of making you feel like you're interacting through a toddler. As a small child you are clumsy, slow, very poorly armed and armored against the shadows that crawl along the walls and roar out through the dark... your only defense is to hide and find comfort in the warmth in your teddybear guide and traveling companion.  There are a few jumpscares, but absolutely no gore... this game uses nothing but unease, shadows and noises, the surreality of childhood nightmares and exagerations, and the inherent helplessness of your character as the basis for it's horror. A significant part of the entire storyline involves some well written emotional manipulation; if you play these kinds of games in any sort of emersive mind-set (or you're just kinda over-emotional like I can be), you will get a far greater experience from this game. You'll be motivated to help the child through this journey, feel afraid of the creepiness of this world, and seeing the tale through the end will feel rather moving in bad and good ways... potentially triggery ways, depending on your own childhood...  If you don't do emersive gaming, if you dont allow yourself to play these kinds of games as if you were nervous about the surroundings, if you just plow through these kinds of hide-from-the-monster horror games... this will be a short game with not much meat on it, and you will likely feel more dissapointed than profound.  Recommended to purchase on sale. Despite the effort and atmosphere that obviously went into the game, the full price of $20 is just a little bit steep for the length.",1,0

400660,Reverse Crawl,"It's a cute little rpg game where you fight waves of enemies with your own troops. It is NOT a game that let's ypu play as the dungeon, as described.  You don't even really play as the baddie, despite the fact that you are an undead, you are still defending your kingdom against invaders.  The combat is interesting and strategic with mayn different ways to customize your troops to match your playstyle.  The story is cute but rather shallow.  One thing I really didn't like is that the game punishes you massively for making some decisions. Also the final can be extremely and over the top hard. I have yet to achieve one of the good endings.  Overall it is worth the asking price.",1,0

It's the most realistic pinball simulator in terms of ball-physics that feel just right but yet supplements that with some really great set-pieces that wouldn't be achievable on a physical machine. The DLC on offer just keeps making this an even better and better investment.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Seriously, if you are looking at reviews right now, just ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game! -10/10 &lt;- No joke  The story mode's fun, the online mode's amazing, and there's HUNDREDS of hours of gameplay to work at. I've sunk around 75 hours in it already, and I haven't come close to doing a third of what's available! There's almost 200 missions available when you include GTAV and GTA online.  If you don't have this right now, GET IT! It is well worth the whole $59.99. You've no excuse for NOT owning this game if it ever gets on the summer sales. It's a no-brainer then!  ...and if you are worried about longevity, Rockstar is constantly putting out updates, banning cheaters, and adding content to the game. This will last you a good few years of enjoyment!  In addition, the game is INSANELY optimized. I run it with a GTX660 and I'm able to get 60fps while still being able to crank all the settings to high (with a few exceptions) at crisp 1080p without any crashes whatsoever! I stutter every once and a while and on occassion freeze (not completely, alt-tabbing is enough to fix it), but c'mon, I know a guy who gets 60fps@1080p playing this game using  intel integrated graphics!

And also, give us the ammount of cards that you would get in a pack in real life. Overall, the obvious push for microtransactions makes this game yet another pay to win game.

I quite enjoy the simplicity of it, granting the player a great deal of freedom while always having their own goals and targets. In many ways this game returns to the heart of what made simulation games good, back when simulation was the top of the industry. To think that this quality of process was given by a couple of previously unheard of programmers really puts the flaws of modern industry into perspective.  Pick this up if you want a simple yet addictive game to toy with the idea of developing other games... No really, it's quite fun. 8.9/10",1,0

226320,Marvel Heroes Omega,"Worst game ever. It's poorly optimized and every update tons of lag complaints are made by its playerbase. One guy could even run Star Citizen on max settings and Marvel Heroes still lagged for him.   Bad Devs: They release content that isn't finished just to please the players and then months later they decide to fix it. Not only that but they ban you for the most simple things. One time I said in Social Chat, 'prostitution should be legal' and then seconds later I'm banned. I did nothing wrong and if other players can curse and talk about gays, guns, and other opinions then I sure can have mine.  Overpriced items: Most of the things you have to buy with G coins are very overpriced. Some things are ranging into 20-40 dollars for insignificant bonuses, etc.  Community: The community is trash. Simple as that. Due to the overwhelming amount of pure crap in the game most noobs asks questions in the chat. Sometimes everyone continues their conversation as if you never asked anything (politely). And then some people respond very negatively toward you because of how many noobs want answers to their questions.  Then there are people who ignore you for tiny things.

205100,Dishonored,"Dishonored is one of the few games you start playing and dont know what awaits you in the next 5-12 hours. I for myself had a ''wtf''-moment the first half hour I played it. The graphics looked quite comical and reminded me of other games were the textures look painted. But I got after that and was surprised of a gameplay that is uncomparable to games like Assasins Creed or Splinter Cell. The freedom of choice you have while lurking through a London-like City in a steampunk-environment was a big reason for me to play on. And after a few hours I felt really comfortable not only in completing storyline-quests but in exploring every corner of a certain area to get behind every mystery or secret I could find. The dark athmosphere makes it quite hard to just go in for brutal close-combat and so it comes that you always have the choice of sneaking or knocking some enemies out without killing them. When it comes to Skills, Abilities and Weapons I have to say that it is lacking a big variety of such. You just got like 4-5 really usefull spells and a view weapon-improvements that are really necessary, but you could also play the game without any of this just using a knife and a bit of imagination and fantasy. If youre a fan of a mystic and dark Storyline this is a game to aim for but when you buy it with the intention to feel like playing Neverwinter Nights or other RPGs you will be a bit disappointed. 7/10 Points.",1,0

The story wasn't engaging me, there were a lot of times I felt boredom due to puzzles being simplistic, the limited world the game has to offer didn't do it just justice either. Sure everything is cuddly and cute, but that didn't save it for me.    A lot of people were very positive towards this game and I feel let down. Wondering if that was more about it being Double Fine rather than a reflection of the actual game.    It's not a bad game however, I would rate it as mediocre and I don't think Act II will save this for me.

435300,We Know the Devil,"We Know The Devil is a story about three bad kids who are only bad because the world tells them that they are. It's a story about identity and friendship and queerness and love, and feeling alone and left out. It's about wanting to be good, but not being able to because the world is cruel.  Aevee Bee's writing and Mia Schwartz's drawings and Alec Lambert's music channel a mix of anxiety and innocence that those who were bad kids or who still are will recognize. The story echoes teenage feelings of isolation and longing, and fraught love and friendship, and not knowing who you are and being sort of scared to find out. It's only about an hour long, but in that short time, the characters Venus, Jupiter, and Neptune are all beautifully realized, and I played through it several times (during its initial release on DateNighto) to make different choices and learn more about each of them.  The world is cruel, and tells us that we're bad, but we can fight against the actual, literal Devil and maybe we can stop believing them.",1,0

I dont have many bad things to say about it besides a few these few things. The combat is pretty easy. All you have to do is wait to counter. The boarding process gets pretty old pretty quick. Same thing over and over. The last thing being its not Assassin's Creed really. Edward doesn't have to many missions with the Assassins until the last 5ish hours of the game (not including the contracts). The sea shantys are great, its fun to use the Jackdaw the story was slow at first but then kicked in a little while in like most AC games. Sad game but sort of happy in a way.

359390,Amnesia™: Memories,"Overall I really enjoyed this game, but like a lot of otome games it has some problematic aspects along with the good ones.  First, the art is really beautiful even if the characters' outfits are completely, hilariously absurd. All of the sprites and CGs are really pretty, and the backgrounds are sort of a muted colors with white.  Unlike some otome games where you spend the first part of the game getting to know the characters and then figuring out which ones you want to romance, this game makes you choose immediately and then you are locked into that guy's route and can only succeed or fail (spectacularly) at it.  The good part about this is that the stories for each guy are very different, and as your character starts with amnesia (like the title) the mysterious and unknown parts of your life are different between routes. The relationships you have to the love interests and other characters change, which is really interesting and gives the game a lot of replayability since each route is basically its own thing.  The stories are all very engaging, but there are some definite yandere aspects to some of the relationships, so if that isn't your cup of tea you may want to look into which guys have that before playing so that you can avoid those routes. Or choose them, I guess, if you want to be locked in a cage by a possessive crazy person. :)  The bad ends definitely kill you, and since the MC has amnesia, she does tend to fall into the otome heroine trope of being fairly passive. There's a story reason for it, obviously, but if you're looking for a spunky MC with her own personality you won't find that here. MC has a few moments, but she's clearly intended to be pretty bland so that you can read whatever you want into her.  I recommend this game, it's a beautiful game with an engaging story, but it's definitely a Japanese otome game in a lot of ways which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it.",1,0

I don't think this game is really worth the $4.99 price it's listed on here for the following reasons: 1) Game is over 4 years old  2) is just the base game (I don't think it's been updated with any of the content that the CURRENT iOS or Android vesions have) so we are paying 5 times more for a port of the older version of a game that is on on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"So, overall game is very good. But let us start with each aspect of the game separately.  Story  Actually for Lord of the Rings saga the story for this game is good. I will say very good. Okay if you have been paying attention you'll know that the main character Tallion had his family killed by orcs and he goes on a revenge killing spree. Pretty generic right? Well I disagree. Why? Because Tolkien was one of the first authors who used this kind of 'revenge for your loved ones' thing in his books, if you have read them of course, but gamers don't have time for books ;). That is why I think this story suits the game perfectly. Yes it is a generic story, but it is good. Story is interesting, okay sometimes it falls short, but it's no big deal soon after it picks up. I personally really liked the story, because it was about a time period which is a little bit mysterious. Story happens before Lord of the Rings trilogy, but after Hobitt and it answers questions, how Sauron came to be, who created the rings of power and so on If you haven't read the books then it is quite interesting. Voice acting is very good. Main characters, only few in number, are good, not great and deep, but good and interesting.  Story 7/10  Gameplay  Two words - Nemesis System. This thing is AWESOME. It is very innovative. Okay I will give you an exampe. SPOILER ALERT AHEAD!! An orc, who looks generic, mostly, kills me.    Tallion is a wraith so he can't die.    Afetwards orc is promoted to captain for killing the ranger (me). And I of course go to get my revenge. This time he however escapes to live another day. A time passes. Nemesis system is an AI of orc army so that means my nemesis goes killing some orcs and advances in power to become a veteran captain (appearance of him also changes) and very powerful I might add. Then I get a showdown with him and I kill him by SEVERING his head off :D. The good thing is that the orcs remember you, your past encounters, and they usually say something like this: 'Hey It's you again? This time I'm going stab you so hard, your ancsestors will feel it.' The Nemesis system makes enemies NOT generic, it makes them feel like actual charaters. In 9 h of my gameplay I didn't see other orc captain like the ones I killed. The game feels a little bit like Assassins creed/Batman, in a good way :). Gameplay is very similar to these games. Map is quite big with lots of things to do, lot of sidequests and events, of course collectiables.   Gameplay 9/10   Overall 8/10  Game is very good. Nemesis system I like to think is the future for open world games. In recent games it is one of the most innovative things. If you like Lord of the Rings saga, buy the game, if you like fast paced action and memorable encounters, this game is for you.",1,0

383870,Firewatch,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect going in, but from the first sarcastic remark, I was hooked. Though not without its share of flaws (run length, somewhat predictable plot, occasionally irksome backtracking), Firewatch draws you in with an intriguing mystery and some beautiful views, but its two main characters are really what sets it apart. They are both perfectly voice acted and brilliantly characterized.   Pros: Believable, thought out characters Excellent voice acting Witty dialogue Absorbing mystery The ending isn't overdone and fits well That sunset though  Cons: Underwhelming conclusion to the mystery Extremely linear Backtracking Short for the price  Firewatch is more like an interactive art piece than a typical game. Though games of this type are becoming more common, Firewatch really knocked it out of the park in my opinion. 8/10",1,0
224760,FEZ,"At first glance, this game seems like your standard charming 2D indie platformer, but you'd be wrong.  You play as Gomez, and your goal is to find a bunch of cubes and cube fragments scattered across various worlds in order to restore the universe to its normal state (and keep it from tearing apart). The twist comes in once you receive the titular Fez: you can rotate the world in a three-dimensional manner, but it stays 2D from your perspective. Platforms can grow, grow apart/closer, or disappear entirely depending on how the world is rotated. Later on, there are quite a few challenging puzzles to decipher (you may need internet guides for more than a few of them), and some additional items to collect besides the golden cubes. My only real complaint is just a standard problem with platformers: it's easy to get lost, and you'll do quite a bit of backtracking for stuff you've missed.  Overall, very highly recommended! Also, this game will run fine on computers that don't seem to meet the system requirements (I have no idea why a 2.8 GHz Core 2 Duo is recommended, this runs great on my 1.9 GHz Core 2 Duo system), so if you have a toaster of a computer, give this a shot anyway.",1,0
16810,Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization,"Disregard Civilization, aquire Colonization.  Seriously, it's a standalone expansion pack, so unless you have an extra 10 bucks and want to give vanila Civ4 a shot I'd just go strait to this one.  ---  If you're familiar with Total War you will NOT be familiar with this. Rather than focusing on your army and it's compossition, placement and what not, Colonization puts in the role of governer, not general. Micromanaging a number of towns and exploiting the new world's natural resources and dealing with those bloody natives, either peacefully or by blowing their brains out with your supior technology. The overarching goal is to declare independance from Europe, but if you fail to complete the goal in time you still get a score victory for your efforts.  As for combat, you have an overly simplified % chance of victory. Though you can't actually take an entire town in a single turn like you can in Total War. Conflict lasts over several years. But unlike vanila Civ4 (And here comes one of the biggest preferences to Col over Civ) unit production is quite involved, so you wont end up having a single conflict over a single city last over a few decades or even centuries.  So in a nutshell: War game meets Colony Simulator :p",1,0
65080,Kaptain Brawe,"This is one that I recommend only with some rather strong reservations, and on the condition that you get it on sale with a massive discount. For one, this is a game that I replayed twice in an effort to add to my in-game achievements total. I still can't really say why, escept that it was relaxing. But, in any case, that should tell you just how short it is. When you add in the fact that it also is a bit glitchy, causing a need to sometimes go into the auto-saves and load the most recent one, thus doing some amount of replaying, in order to successfully continue the game, the issue becomes even more glaring. The in-game hint system is flawed as well, so if you do get stuck, you can't really rely on it. Fortunately, most of the puzzles are quite simple to figure out, and there are only a couple parts that might truly trip a general gamer up a bit. I managed to get almost all of the in-game achievements with little trouble before getting too bored to keep on with it, but even the developers apparently no longer remember how the trickier ones are earned, or just aren't telling, so if you're playing for that reason at all, be warned that you're mostly on your own there. All of this said, despite the glitches, simplicity, and other issues, the game is actually pretty fun if you enjoy point-and-click gameplay. I really liked the light humor, the 'alternate' ending, and the look and sound of the game as a whole. Yes, it does get boring fast after the first playthrough, and the glitches are irritating when they do trip you up, but if you get it in a bundle like I did, or from a really good sale, then it's definitely worth trying out. If they ever add on trading cards or Steam achievements, I'll say that even more enthusiastically, though most of the time I don't really view those things as important.

My problem is that the game crashes every (precisely) 15 minutes. People on the forums are saying that this is caused by either having a pen tablet installed or a touch screen monitor. I refuse to uninstall my pen tablet. I intend to keep this game because I know it will eventually be good (and I have nothing else to spend the money on), but it will take time to fix.  But seriously, let's be honest here: This game is still in BETA/Early access.  I will do a completely new review once I am actually able to play the game for more than 15 minutes at a time.   Update:  I managed to solve the 15 minute crash problem by disabling the tablet and touch services via the task manager. I can now play the game more than 15 minutes, but I still intend to wait for a proper fix.   Update 2 Sept 22, 2016:  Well they went ahead and screwed it up AGAIN.

The story really pulls the strings of your heart, and it also tugs a bit on your mind. The plot is certainly interesting and the concepts open new trains of thought which only add to the game. The replayability is subjective to how much you like the game. I strongly suggest playing through on hard first. It makes the game feel more accomplished in many ways. The second, could be on easy. To allow you to focus more soley on the story and enviorment. Once again. A great game.",1,0

Those familiar with the Tropcio series will feel right at home here with the fan favorite city building style that Tropico has to offer, but with some distinct gameplay, UI and graphical changes that spice up the series. For those unfamiliar with this game as well as the previous installments, the series is very Sim City-esque but with a refreshing take on the city building genre, giving you free rein on your citizens to do what you please. Want to be a absolute dictator, policing your city completely, riging elections and stopping the immigration of people all together? You can. Overall, I highly recommend this game, as well as the previous Tropico games. It might be worth it to pick up Tropico 3 or 4 with all DLC's if they go on sale before buying this game to get a feel for the series.",1,0

As a fan of action-mixed RPG games, I found the gameplay quite enjoyable, especially when you have collected a few upgrades for your weapons. The constant GPS cache and artifact collecting can get dull pretty fast, but thankfully, they're not essential to the main plot and game progression. The storyline itself was decent enough for a modern game (even though it is really linear) and definitely better than what the original games had. Lara and the rest of the ensamble have distinct personalities this time, and that makes the story more captivating and lets the player get invested in the plot as a whole. The graphics are really good for the year the game was released in and Lara's hair physics is quite a joy to watch.  This is a great game for one or two playthroughs and even offers a fun multiplayer. I would definitely recommend the game, especially since it's constantly sold at a discounted price.",1,0

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I had to edit my review and turn it to negative because I'm kind of disappointed about what this game has become. There are plenty of negative reviews, nearly all of them tell the same thing and mine will be no different. I will just briefly tell you what has gone wrong with this game.   Payday 2 was brillant when it's just released. Yes, there were some technical issues, that's okay but gameplay was awesome. They wanted to took all the best from Payday: The Heist and multiply it. More heists, more masks, more stealth, wide variety of upgrades for the wide variety of guns - all this stuff was supposed to make the game bigger and better. And it actually did. All aforementioned is the pros that made me get back into Payday 2 over and over again.   Now it's two years after the release. I thought the developers would fix bugs but it's become clear long ago that developers decided to go the other way, the way of beating the money out of players by making tons of dlc's. Some of them are useless such as character packs and new masks. Some of them add new weapon which is overpowered in comparison to the default guns so you have to buy this weapon unless you want your criminal career to be over in no time (especially on Death Wish difficulty). Dlc's with new heists also make some sense but now most of players get stuck in two or three heists that give you most XP to gain levels quickly so I don't know. What I do know for sure is that the amount of money you have to waste on this game, if you want to play with others on equal terms, will surely make your wallet cry: 27 dlc's with the cost of approximately 5 USD each. Do the maths.   Another disappointing thing is bugs and technical issues that were not fixed since the release (!). It really lets me down especially considering that there were a lot of promises from devs (such as safehouse upgrade and solving issues with connection) that were also never redeemed. What a shame.   Payday: The Heist's main feature is team work. Payday 2 had this feature until shotgun pack, sniper pack and pack with minigun and RPG came out. Now there is no need in team work - just rush through the heist with the overpowered sniper rifle and you will probably be able not to go into bleedout even once. Stealth is still pretty fun but it's limited with some illogical things such as not being able to take more than a couple of body bags to wrap up corpses of guards.    To summarize I want to repeat that it was a fun game. It IS a fun game now but if you have money to buy dlc's. It's so sad that such a great game has turned to something so shameful and obnoxious.

243950,Divinity: Dragon Commander,"Where to start... First, lets talk about the concept and setting of this game. Being set in a fantasy realm, where technolgy and magic are blended together into a neat Steampunk-like setting. I must admit, it's very appealing.  The gameplay itself, when fighting the enemies, and waging war, seems to split itself between turn based combat, and RTS. Admittedly it's a bit dull, and also rather repetitive, shifting between outright easy and relaxing, to stressfully hard, with no warning between the two. Some might find that appealing, but I honestly don't. HOWEVER, if things go badly for you, you can also jump into the battle yourself, as you are a giant fire-breathing dragon who also is wearing a jetpack. Yes. You are a dragon. With wings, with a jetpack. Very appealing.  Outside of the combat, you take on the role of deciding how the empire should be run in terms of law, certain economical factors, racism, ect. To be honest, I think this was my favorite part of the game, as your morals in the real world don't necessarily work the same in a fantasy world. Here's a good example. In the real world, I believe religious stories should not be part of teaching, my reasons being my own. However, in this game, it made sense to have such stories taught, due to the fantastical nature of the world in which the characters lived. Remember, dragon with jetpack. You would need that kind of teaching.  And as an added little bonus, for once in a game, the undead are not considered evil, or even dark and potentially bad. They are simply just people. A little overtly pious, but people none the less. This is the first game to do that for me, which may be small, but it's a bug plus.  All in all, it's a fun game. Maybe nothing that'll last the test of time, but still a game worth playing.",1,0

250620,Among the Sleep,"Wow what a great and trippy ride! Among the Sleep was far better then what I expected it to be and much more deep also. It dwelves into the childs mind and establishes a form of nostalgic fear. It will find its way into being one of the creepiest games you will play as well as intense. The vice acting was great along with your companion Teddy just making it all work and fit and by the end of it I had very little to complain about. However there are some things worth noting about the game that needs to be brought to light for the optional buyers out there. First, the campaign is not long at all. Two hours tops. So this leads to the second thing, the price for a two hour game is a bit high. 20 dollars US regularly. If you're interested and see this game on a steam sale i reccomend getting it quick and instantly. Now also the last real thing I can complain about is that the game isn't very challengin either. Its scary and has its moments of wonder and intense hiding but really it was very quick and easy to figure out. So in comparison to Outlast (If you have played that game) this is a walk in the park. However I still find it being very enjoyable and worth the two hours and it will even be more fun to watch your friends play in the dark for the first time. Enjoy!  8/10",1,0

Pros +Great crew members (Mordin and Thane in particular) +Your decisions have meaningful impacts within this game +Graphics still hold up well +Normandy has much more life +No more elevator rides that give you enough time to take a nap +Resource minigame is more engaging than in Mass Effect (where you drove around in a buggy across very generic bumpy worlds looking for light, heavy and rare metals for credits)  Cons -Storyline seems arbitrary at a fair amount of points -Personally, I dislike the new ammo system -I told Kelly to feed my fish but I still found them dead :(  Short digression - A lot of people criticize Shepard working with Cerberus in this game (valid) since they're a notorious organization with terrorist inclinations and a disregard for ethics. However, the relation between the Systems Alliance and Cerberus is not analogous to the US and al-Qaeda, but more like Afghanistan and al-Qaeda. Cerberus is still fighting for humanity albeit in a twisted fashion. If anything, the Asari and other council nations represent the US and the west while the Alliance is a rising power like China. Cerberus is a terrorist group that wants human power but with an absolute disregard for anything that doesn't support their specific agenda (since they believe they are the best, fastest, and possibly only hope for humanity).",1,0

This game, in 4 hours, made me laugh so hard, afraid and scared and at the same time I was looking to myself crying like a had never cryied before. Those feelings combined with the best game story I´ve ever seen, made me realise that a game does´t need graphics or gameplay to be a good one... This game is the real example that video games are art... This is why I play games for, the story line combined with a perfect and brilliant soundtrack gives you a great experience, an adventure that touches you so much that since the game starting till the ending I assure that you will be watching one of the best experiences of your life that a media such as this one can give...

255070,Abyss Odyssey,"It looks amazing, it sounds amazing, and (once you get the hang of it) it plays like a dream. Seriously, I was a bit upset after playing it for the first time after buying it, but once I learned how to pull off certain combos, it grew on me like a bad case of hemmorrhoids. In a good way, of course. As of this writing, I only have an hour of play time in and there's a reason for that. My only beef with the game is that it's so unforgiving. An hour's worth of gameplay, and I have made so little progress, people have started nominating me for a position in the federal government. In order to respawn anywhere other than the starting area, you need a camp token. Where do you find them? Hell if I know. Some merchants (very few and far between) will sell one and only one, but they're ridiculously high, and you lose them permanently if you die. On rare occasions, you may stumble across one, but don't hold your breath. If you die (and you will die) you get one chance to respawn by means of fighting as a soldier until you reach an activated check point. My problem is that I've only found three tokens, of which I lost two, and my only activated checkpoint is a hell of a way away from anywhere I need or want to be.

338930,,"I'll be the voice of dissent here but this game has really dissapointed me.  Being a huge Platinum Games fan from the Clover era i went into this with great expectations, mostly from the combat and level design ... and i found out they are both horrible. For whatever reason they decided to focus all on the weapons customizations instead on the combat ... You can customize a lot of guns and blades but there are no combos ... the combat gameplay revolves all around dodging and button mashing until you get to the super attack, it's tedious and in my opinion the worst Platinum Games ever made.  One of the many issues in the gameplay is the fact that they bind the same button for transformation, dodging and super attack, this is disastrous since at hardest difficulty every hit you take drains almost half you total hp making dodging even more important and it happens many times that you have a super attack moment where when you press the dodge button it makes you attack and this lets you vulnerable to the next enemy hit that you will have no way to dodge if this happens.  The absence of a targeting is really detrimenting to many fights, you won't be able to attack what you want, making destroying objects to get heal a total nightmare in many scenarios.  I have no idea how the Korra game had so low receptions while this is so acclaimed, the Korra game was short and the level design was bad, but it had a solid, really deep combat system to evolve and master.  I am not a fan of the Transformer series and i picked this up only because it's from Platinum Games, i think most of the people praising this game are really driven by nostalgia.",-1,1

The music is downright GRATING; seriously, just turn it off and play something you like in the background. Gameplay itself is simplistically boring and repetitive.

409450,The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians,"As a fan of dungeon-crawlers, I'm always on the lookout for something new. This is an underrepresented genre on Steam, which is actually rather surprising.  Wizardry ,  The Bard's Tale ,  Might &amp; Magic , and numerous other grid-based franchises got their start on computers, so one would assume there'd be more games to 'carry the torch'. It's understandable, considering how niche the genre has become, but I can't get enough of them. Managames' The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is an extremely adept dungeon-crawler, and does more than enough to quench anyone's thirst.  Considering the genre, you can't go into this game expecting much in the way of plot. You're several miles deep in a labyrinthian prison, and all of the in-mates have broken free. There are also a plethora of fell-beasts inhabitating the halls because...why not? It's on you to put together a party of four to find the prisoners and escape this nightmare. Like other dungeon-crawlers, this game emphasizes exploration and combat above all else. Your survival is dependent on coming to grips with the battle-system, finding better loot, and never taking anything for granted.  One of the interesting aspects of this game is the class-system. Each class is denoted by their role in battle. Basically you'll want a party consisting of a tank, two damage dealers, and a healer. These roles are self-explanatory, and utilizing them to their fullest extent is mandatory in order to progress. I really like this system, because everyone has to pull their own weight. In RPGs, there tends to be times where party-members aren't really doing anything. They're just another bum with a sword, and you invest in their growth until eventually they learn a spell, or get some important piece of equipment that makes them really useful. Not so with this game, everyone has to play their part, or the entire party will be wiped out.   Combat itself is 'real-time with pauses', which suits the class-system just fine. Most abilities operate on cool-down timers, so it's up to you to rotate through them, while paying attention to the current situation. The tank has numerous methods for pulling aggro, but you still have to keep your over-zealous mages in check, because they can get crushed in a few hits. You also have to pay attention to what the enemy is doing. Their next move is always shown on-screen, so you have ample time to prepare. Over time, you might find that certain strategies are effective at dealing with most mobs of monsters, but you always have to take great care in handling Elite foes and bosses. Every boss in this game has a particularly unique aspect that makes for fresh and exciting battles. There are also a handful of instances where moving around can be advantageous, so that's worth keeping in mind as well.  This game's approach to difficulty is very fluid. There will come a time where you'll feel like you're truly stuck. You've exhausted every available tactic, found the best equipment possible, but you just can't seem to beat that next boss. This is the part where you decide on what to do next. The difficulty in this game is thoroughly balanced, so it shouldn't be impossible for a decent party. However, if that hopeless feeling gets the better of you, the difficulty can be customized at any time. So if you think you could beat the boss if he had 10, 5, or even 1% less health, then sure...go for it. You can always re-adjust the difficulty later. Alternatively, if things are getting too easy (or not punishing enough), you can raise the settings.   Playing around with the difficulty sliders is also helpful if you're using different parties. If for example you wanted a party of four damage-dealers, you could adjust the settings until that becomes an actually viable tactic. It's a neat idea, and while I find the relationship between tanks, healers, and damage dealers to be far more exciting, the level of freedom is still welcome. Experimenting with the difficulty and how it affects various party make-ups can be compelling in itself. There is still plenty of challenge for the purists, who would rather focus on improving their tactics than take the easy way out. Best of all, this system completely defeats the purpose of grinding. Not that you would if you could anyway, since there are a limited number of monsters on every level. Still, it has all of the functionality of making the game easier, but without the large time investment. The 20+ hours you invest into a play-through of this game are going to be spent purely adventuring, not running in-between tiles to fight random encounters.  Another particularly nice attribute of this game is that you won't spend a lot of the time saving &amp; reloading. When it comes to dungeon-crawlers, I tend to play very conservatively. If somebody dies, I reload my last save. If I get back-attacked and I know somebody won't survive the encounter, I reload my last save. The stats I gain from my level-up aren't good enough? Yep, that last save is getting reloaded for certain. It gets annoying after awhile. With this game however, it isn't really necessary. For one, everyone receives experience, even if they lose all of their HP during battle. Characters that are knocked out also recovery shortly afterwards, and HP/MP replenishes quickly. This, combined with the lack of load-times when moving between levels, makes the game really appealing to play. While there are brutally powerful attacks, there's nothing that can really be considered an insta-death spell. If your party is wiped out, you can't blame the Gods of RNG.  The dungeons in this game are all very good. While combat is definitely favored, there are some puzzles to figure out, and even a few devious ones that lead to substantial gear-upgrades. Each level has unique qualities that help it stand out, and the designs don't go overboard, so nothing ever feels like a gimmick. This creates a very natural sense of exploration. It's rewarding to poke around, and since every floor takes about an hour or so to complete, you can make substantial progress in a reasonable amount of time. Also, keep in mind that the time spent on each level can extend dramatically, depending on your difficulty settings.   With its great battle-system, unique approach to difficulty, and a sizable amount of content, The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is an easy recommendation.

275670,Space Run,"If you are a  masochist Galaxy Trucker  like me, you will probably get at least 10-20 hours of fun out of Space Run.  For those who are wondering if this is anything like the board game Galaxy Trucker, I tell you   it is!  With the twist of having both the building and the flying of GT compressed in a single phase.   In ‘Space Run’ you build your ship as you fly, so the impeding urge to build quick is still present and you have little to no time to adapt to the new events of the trip. As you complete your delivery assignments you get money to upgrade your parts (engine, shields, lasers, etc) and if you fail a mission all you have to do is try it again. The events will be the same within each mission, so after 3 to 4 tries you probably ace each level.  You can also re-run the same mission with you newly upgraded gear to try to maximize your score and money. I played around 20 different missions before it got more difficult and I would like to face in this game. I think the game should have some kind of ‘pause to build’ mode for casual players (such as myself).",1,0

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"This isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Does it suck to lose progress? Yes. But you can always get it back by playing.   As far as the game itself goes, it seems like you have a slight advantage over the monster right off the bat, but if it reaches stage 2 it has the advantage, and stage 3 you just lose. It's actually hard to beat the monster if you aren't in a coordinated team or the person playing the monster is experienced.  It really is just a big game of chase. I would have expected more actual hunting and more of a cat and mouse game.  The upside to free to play is the complete lack of a marketplace store that is typical of the free to play style games. You can unlock everything in the game just by playing and without having to pay any real money, which is awesome.",1,0
242880,"Sir, You Are Being Hunted","Sir, You are Being Hunted, it's a FPS stealth game, where you, the player, must find 17 pieces of rock across 5 different procedurally generated islands.

Now, if the length of the game was about 1 or 2 hours, with 5 or less stones to be collected, better textures, detailed environment that's it's not just a bunch of static models, a smaller map, the game would be better.",-1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"Do not buy this game, go straight past 'add to cart' and keep your $60.  This game was falsely advertised. It's a crime to the Game world. The fact they no longer advertise the game as Multiplayer on this very site just proves they're trying to cover it up.  The fact steam has to disclaim there will be no special exemptions to refund this game is self-explanatory.   Its a $%#@ DISGRACE!   I pre-ordered this game on the hope that what we had seen was only a speck of sand in comparison to the amazing scope this game could accomplish.  At first I loved the art style and the adventure that awaited before I got off my first planet thrilled me. It was not long before it became a drag and I was rinsing and repeating the same thing over and over again.  I still had hope and after jumping through multiple black holes crossing who knows how far in distance it was clear to me that whatever lay waiting at the end wasn't worth it.  This isn't like going to the movies and not enjoying the film, this is like buying a fake painting.  You can like this game for whatever reason but you can not come forward and tell me that they didn't lie to us and promise us something else. In my country I have the right to get a refund if a product isn't as advertised (Australian Consumer Law). Steam decides to completely ignore my support complaints so my only alternative is to sue someone. Were I not facing a very expensive trial I would without a doubt do so.   The only thing i can do is give this miserly thumbs down and tell you to not make the same mistake I did and spend your well earned money or in my case my birthday money on this wreck of a game...",-1,1

That's right, between 8 and 12. HAVE FUN SCROLLING BETWEEN 30 INDISTINGUISHABLE CHARACTERS.   And every single time you transfer anyything, the game double checks that you're ready to transfer. 'Are you sure?' Well, yeah, seeing as there's ABSOLUTELY NO DOWNSIDE IF I ACCIDENTALLY TRADE SOMETHING BETWEEN MY OWN PARTIES.  This game is just so close to being good, but I'd say if you're really interested in strategy games, you might only get about 10-20 hrs out of this before getting really god damn tired of the menus and quitting. It really does just come down to menu management separated by a card mini-game.  Overall: worth checking out (when on sale), but don't feel bad when you get sick of it and quit.",-1,1

The gameplay is solid, reminiscant of older third person gameplay- gameplay I personally liked, so perhaps I'm just out of touch... Either way, it is fluid, and feels natural. The controls could do with better placement (running and getting into cover) and shooting gets stale after a while (my advice is try to get all the weapon achievements, it helps you try different weapons and keeps it fresher).  No, if you're playing this, you're playing for the story. And it's worth £10 easily.",1,0

That said, I really would like to see more of this sort. Whether you approach this as a standalone product or not, the fleshing out of the game world is fantastic and is worth experiencing at least once. If its length bothers you, catch it on sale.

It re-defines the concept of stealth games, giving you plentyful choices and patterns to pick from in order to achieve your objectives, I'll make the review simple.   Compared to other hitmans...  Improvements:  *Stealth System  *Disguise System totally remade *Concealment of weapons improved *Paths and missions clearances *Weapons variety *Graphics in general *Multiplayer features (Contracts)  Steps down:  *Money is worthless on Single Player *There's barelly any incentive to make missions right *You cant pick Loadouts per missions  Overall, the game was a bast improvement over prior games, it got a new skin and new way of doing everything, it's still the same hitman mechanics to the core, but with more sense to them.

57640,Broken Sword 1 - Shadow of the Templars: Director's Cut,"Played the original version over a decade ago. It was fun going through the adventure again, with a more mature mindset. It goes to show you that a good adventure game uses cleverly designed puzzles, and Broken Sword is an excelent example of this.

265630,Fistful of Frags,"John Felix Anthony Cena Jr. (born April 23, 1977) is an American professional wrestler, rapper, actor and reality television show host signed to WWE. Cena has been credited by WWE as the public face of that organization, and has served as its franchise player since 2005. Cena is the host of American Grit on FOX.  Cena started his pro wrestling career in 1999 with Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), and won the UPW Heavyweight Championship the following year. Cena signed a developmental contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later renamed to WWE) in 2001, debuting on the WWE main roster in 2002. From a generic character in 2002, Cena morphed into an arrogant and edgy rapper for the time period of 2002-2003. Cena later transitioned to his current character, which he describes as a 'goody-two shoes Superman'. However, Cena has been labeled as the 'most polarizing pro wrestler ever' as his character has many supporters and many detractors.  So far, Cena has won 24 championships, with 15 reigns as a world champion (12 times as WWE Champion/WWE World Heavyweight Champion and three times as World Heavyweight Champion), five reigns as United States Champion and four reigns as world tag team champion (two World Tag Team and two WWE Tag Team). Furthermore, he is a 2012 Money in the Bank ladder match winner, a two-time Royal Rumble winner (2008, 2013), and a three-time Superstar of the Year Slammy Award winner (2009, 2010, 2012). Cena has the fourth-highest number of combined days as WWE World Heavyweight Champion, behind Bruno Sammartino, Bob Backlund, and Hulk Hogan. He has also headlined WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania, on five different occasions (WrestleManias 22, 23, XXVII, XXVIII, and 29) over the course of his career.  Outside of wrestling, Cena has released the rap album You Can't See Me, which debuted at No. 15 on the US Billboard 200 chart, and starred in the feature films The Marine (2006), 12 Rounds (2009), Legendary (2010), The Reunion (2011), Trainwreck (2015), and Sisters (2015).[19] Cena has also made appearances on television shows including Manhunt, Deal or No Deal, MADtv, Saturday Night Live, Punk'd, Psych, and Parks and Recreation. He was also a contestant on Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race, where he made it to the final round before being eliminated, placing third in the overall competition.  Cena is involved in numerous philanthropic causes; most notably with the Make-A-Wish Foundation. He has granted the most wishes in Make-A-Wish history.",1,0

251060,Wargame: Red Dragon,"CAUTION: I strongly recommend this game, but I give it a thumbs down as I am writing here about the flaws which should be known to be able to enjoy it - I hope the devs will notice, too.   'Wargame: Red Dragon' is the best 'Wargame' so far and the only somehow realistic RTS game out there.  Enough is written about the awesome parts, so I will mention here what I dislike about it.  The micromanagement is not well done, other games make it significantly more comfortable to manage your units.  The AI is not very good and so if you are not very good at giving your troops really idiot-proof orders, they will get themselves killed easily.  The great 3D terrain is hard to estimate regarding its angles, so you often have the problem that in mountain or hill areas your troops cannot see or shoot the enemy as they are aiming too high or low.  The more you zoom out, the less precise is the information about where your units are standing. The overview is bad.  There is no playable tutorial to prepare you for all this, so yeah, you will lose a LOT of units and you will lose a LOT of matches against AI or humans until you find out how everything works.  The devs should really work on fixing the problems mentioned above or consider them in their next 'Wargame' - it should be more accessible and more comfortable to play, and you should be able to select an AI strategy for your individual units or groups of units so that they can work more autonomously.   Ah, and the naval combat is still bad. It is overpowered and already during the creation of your deck it just feels wrong. You can build a nation-limited deck, e.g. France, and then still add U.S. anti-ship planes or a Japanese Warship for naval combat? This doesn't fit to the rest. And if you already have naval combat, then please, add submarines, too!   So much about the gameplay. Technically, the game is really beautiful. The graphics are nice and the engine is really well-optimized (runs perfectly smooth on any system), and I didn't notice any bugs.  The only thing that is really missing is a better campaign. The game has in theory so much potential to make you feel connected to your troops as every solider even has his own name - so why is there no dramatic story to be told? Instead you play kind of chess, read some text messages and fight random matches against the not-so-bright but at the same time overpowered AI. Quite a disappointment compared to many other RTS gems out there. A scripted campaign to teach you how the game mechanics work (e.g. the campaigns in Blizzard's strategy games) so that you have at least a little chance to survive in multiplayer would be far better.   It is hard to give this game a kinda objective rating as there are no competitors. It somehow has the same problem as the ArmA series - they are ambitious games trying to show a quite realistic approach to warfare, they have significant flaws, but at the same time they have no competitors.  CONS: Bad AI, bad micromanagement, very bad UI (wrong unit position indications really, really suck!), imbalanced naval combat, disappointing campaign.  PROS: Sweet engine, great multiplayer, huge variety of nations and units, deck making is fun, endless tactical possibilities and matches with your friends or against them are some of the best ever seen in RTS games.  I'd rate this 7/10   + 1 point for long-time motivation thanks to awesome multiplayer, map packs and nation packs + 1 point for not having any serious competitors and therefore strongly enriching the RTS genre  equals 9/10.  Now go out there, buy it, lose dozens of matches, get frustrated as ♥♥♥♥, try hard and be victorious in the end.",-1,1

Let me also mention that the voice actors for this was spectacularly done. The emotion feels sincere and has some good moments for the wrong responses.  The negative is probably the morals it trys to teach to the player. Mainly, if a girl is talking to you, lie out of your ♥♥♥ and just tell them what they want to hear.

262390,Cloudbuilt,"Cloudbuilt is a fast paced 3D platformer revolving around a character called Demi. The game takes place in a futuristic environment filled with rebotic hostiles and floating platforms which the players need to overcome throughout the game.   The game itself has a pretty simple concept where the player needs to get from point A to point B, however the path the player chooses completely depends on them which reduces the thought of a very linear game which it couldve been. Some paths may have many enemies where players need to either destroy or dodge attacks whereas other paths may be filled with traps which require extreme reflexive skills with th contols.  From playing this game I have to conclude that this had been one of, if not the best game I have played this year. I absolutely loved every part of this game ranging from trying to past an extremely difficult level (2hrs was the longest) and feeling the satisfaction of completing it to observing the beautifully designed maps. I also have to add that the graphics is pretty well done with a style similar to borderlands, however i do feel that some parts have been 'over done' where too many layers of filters have been added which bought in little drops in framerates but it was fine.  The gameplay is great where players need to control Demi's movements to complete each level with many features to assist them. These include wall running, wall hanging as well as having a jetpack was various abilities for use. A gun is also provided for players to kill enemies if wanted which opens the door to even more play styles.  To conclude I strongly recommend this game to people who love platformers, free running or extremely challenging games and I must say that this game is very worth the money you pay if you like these games.",1,0
65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"This installment of the Civilization series, while not as content packed as Civilization V is, certainly has the potential for many hours of enjoyment.  New features and revamped systems provide a somewhat different experience from Civilization V, but many of these seem to be gimmicky or simply not fleshed out enough. The tech web for example is supposed to encourage diverse playstyles and vastly different choices. What it actually does is ensure that anyone who doesn't 'rush' one of the 3 finisher techs (those that give access to Victory Wonders) is almost certainly going to lose.  Warfare is simplified, with there being a massively reduced number of units to choose from, and there are no faction specific unique units any longer. There are also no forts or citadels, making defensive playstyles somewhat less lucrative.   Rising Tide is a good expansion, although I don't think its worth the asking price in any scenario. It simply doesn't have enough content to justify a $30 investment. At most, I'd recommend dropping $15 on, and that only if you plan to play it for a significant amount of time.  TL;DR I say Beyond Earth is probably worth the purchase if its on sale, but don't get Rising Tide until it gets a steep discount.",1,0

Sound: 7 - Soudtrack is pretty decent so far, the voice acting is quirky but well done. The sound effects could use a bit more variation but it hasn't yet ruined the expeirence.  Controls: 9 - Responsive, So far I only used the wired Xbox360 controller, not the mouse and keyboard or two player (a person on each)  Fun Factor: 8 - So far the game is fun, has a nice storyline and doesn't take itself all too seriously. The feel matches the graphics and sound so I would recommend playing it.  I will return to review after I finish the game for a full review.   Enjoy",1,0

232430,Gone Home,"After going home I wish I could leave it again.  This game is extremely short (2 hours or less), which normally I would count as a negative, but for this game it is a massive plus. The game is boring. That's the best term I can think of for it. It's just flat out boring. A close runner-up term is 'overrated'. I truley think that the only reason this game won any Game of the Year nominations is becasue *Spoilers from here* it has a homosexual character that is not a blatant sterotype or a negative caricature. I agree that it's an important step to have characters like this in modern storytelling, but raving about it and handing out 10/10 scores is just misleading to a consumer.  The story is an extremely standard one of teenage romance with the only true difference being the homosexuality. It's so paint-by-the-numbers that I had called the plot after the first two or three notes from your sister. Initially I was not too annoyed by this because at the beginning of the game they start with an atmosphere of a horror game and I thought perhaps the gay sister storyline would take backseat to something far more interesting. Unfortunatley as the game went on it became more and more clear that the horror aspect was just used as a way to pull people in enough to listen to what turned out to be a dull and cliched story. I was really, desperatley hoping that at the end the writers had done something different, such as finding out that the sister had commited suicide in the attic after her lover leaves her to join the army or something completley out of left field like her demon-ghost uncle ate her, but no. No, we just get the 'Oh, she changed her mind about joining the army and now we're going to live happily ever after away from our parents who just don't understand our love blah blah blah' boring, cliched ending.  In the end I just felt cheated by this game. There are vague rumblings about a much more interesting story within this game (ghosts, crazy uncles), but they are complete Red Herrings to keep you interested enough to suffer through the teenage angst story. Even now, several months after playing this, I still get angry when I think about my wasted time and money. I am disappointed by the game so much that I wish I could remove it from my game library, even if I didn't get any money back for it (Thankfully I got it during a sale and did not pay the outrageous $20 that the game normally costs).  Seriously, if you want a purely narrative driven game then there are games that do so much better than this (Walking Dead, The Stanley Parable, The Wolf Among Us, Myst, Monkey Island, etc.). Please look anywhere else if you want a game that makes you feel, unless you love the feeling of boredom.",-1,0

403190,Planetbase,"The game works beautifully as far as I can tell, runs absolutely fine. However it's incredibly shallow and consists of nothing more than a very repetetive balancing act, battling with the map you've been given to place increasingly large numbers of structures whilst hoping things pan out with your factories and such.  It's far too shallow and requires an inhuman amount of patience to deal with production misery for me to recommend this, but if you really want a game about colonising a planet, then this might do it for you.   EDIT:  Someone called me out on my profile for only having played just over an hour, so I'll explain why I didn't need any more time - Once you've completed the absolute bare essentials of a base which takes around 20 minutes of getting the balance right and building things in a pretty set order, the game becomes a repetetive slog of repeating the process of adding things to your base as you need them (which is sometimes difficult because the connections system is often interfered with by the terrain with no real way to understand why), there is almost no complexity to the game, I'd compare it to Banished with far less content.  In addition, simply checking your resources requires several clicks through menus, a lack of resource display on the main UI and decent hotkeys makes the game a pretty miserable experience unless you're really committed to it.   EDIT 2:  I guess I need to add another edit explaining why my low game time isn't a good enough reason to ignore this review. The game showed no form of complexity or advancement in the first 2 hours, if a game is incapable of getting you on the hook then that's entirely the game's fault. You can unlock the majority of the buildings you'll be using all the time within 15 minutes of starting the game, and you'll be using them so often that I got bored incredibly fast. The game doesn't go anywhere and the only thing you've got to worry about is randomly having your life made even harder by one of the 'disasters' which amount of having to spend more time alt tabbed out waiting for things to be repaired.

550,Left 4 Dead 2,"This game has been #1 on my wishlist for a long time. I've been dying to play it for so long, and now, it's finally mine. I heard mixed comments saying the game was awesome, boring, and completely pointless. My opinion on this? I'm with the people who say L4D2 is a great game. It is insanely fun. Everyone fits in well, the humor is pretty good, and the lovely chocolate helicopters came from here. I consider this  one of the greatest co-op games of all time.   The zombies are also a part of the humor, as I find them funny when they fly like ragdolls with all of your guns, and definitely not scary, (as if I even cared) and the only 'weird' thing you would encounter is the Witch. You'll probably get used to them in a while though. While some missions are repetitive and the community usually auto kicks you, it's a great game. Definitely worth picking up. Regardless of price.   Graphics- 7/10 Gameplay- 7.5/10 Story- 5/10 Audio- 7/10 Replayability- 9/10  .:7.7/10:.  +Lots of humor  +Tons of action  +High replayability +Awesome new characters +Has several funny moments -Stale visuals -Repetitive gameplay",1,0
22330,The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion ,"A magnificent addition to the expansive nature in terms of both fun and size of the Elder Scrolls games. This game is just as good as I remember it, and it's included DLC is also a big plus, specifically the two main expansions.  I wholeheartedly reccommend it for those who don't mind a bit of outdated dialogue and graphics, as the game's liberty and the sheer unrefined enjoyment you'll get from it as a sandbox RPG-fan make up for those things tenfold. Add to that it's modibility and the fact that you can mess around in multiple ways, from being an unquestioned hero, to a nimble-fingered thief, to being a master of magic who makes his own spells, or even the type of person who goes about using the 'kill' command in the console to decimate anyone who looks at him funny (I'm the good guy, I swear!)

227940,Heroes & Generals,"This game is a shining example of how free-to-play all too often = pay-to-win. Eternally in 'Early Access', this game is yet another sad reason why Steam's 'Early Access' program is an overall failure.  Big money weapons are completely OP (e.g. M1/M2 Carbine, Thompson, etc). If you don't pay, good luck spending a few weeks with a catheter and hot pockets and without seeing the sun to earn them without spending cash.  Balancing classes and levels for both teams in skirmish games is a joke. Sometimes it will give more/better tanks to one side or give one side tons of paratroopers. It also doesn't balance player levels properly so newbies often get seal clubbed. It makes for imbalanced and frustrating gameplay if you are a newbie.  Also, the game is riddled with cheating. There are several cheating programs that you can easily find on the Internet which reveal the locations of all enemy players and puts boxes around them, making camoflage/cover almost useless and allowing you to always get the drop on an enemy. I've seen people with 20 or even 30 to 1 K/D in a game. As it is so easy to die in this game, I can imagine that those players were using these programs.  Overall, this game really isn't worth investing any serious time into unless you like pay-to-win games and have the cash to pay so you can win. If you're looking for a free-to-play game that doesn't bone you for not spending tons of cash, look elsewhere. This game is not for you.",-1,0

318650,SunAge: Battle for Elysium,"This initially looks like a low-budget StarCraft ripoff, but after taking a chance on it and playing it for a few hours, it's clear it's much more than that.  It has solid graphics and sound, with easy to identify and well charactered units. Base building is a charm with the power-node system, and the resource distribution (four types!) forces exploration and additional base-building. The game borrows some of the best ideas from StarCraft, Generals, Tiberium Sun and Supreme Commander, and balances them out extremely well; it's less macro-y, faster, and less fiddly than Age Of Empires, but less micro-y, speedfreak tournament hotkey nonsense than StarCraft or Dawn Of War.  It really feels like some of the best bits of the C&amp;C Games, (sneaking transports into the back of enemy bases), but with a little more depth, and it just has a really solid, classic RTS feel that's familiar, yet fresh at the same time.  This one is a hidden gem, and has sleeper hit written all over it. Multiplayer is probably going to be a *blast* with this game.  ",1,1

105600,Terraria,"*WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*  Terraria is the kind of game that can be played over and over without getting boring. I love how the game has a pre-set determined path of events that you have to do in order to keep ranking up in health or loot. First, you pretty much mine until you have enough gold/platinum to create swords, armor, and other weapons. The next step is to fight the Eye of Cthulhu and the Brain of Cthulhu/Eater of Worlds. After that point, you pretty much have enough supplies to go explore the Dungeon and after getting that loot, proceeding on to the underworld. This game just gets extremely fun after this point, in which you find more supprising loot and bosses such as the Destroyer.  I also like how there are 3 main builds of a character:  The melee build, The ranged build, and last but not least: The magic build.  Each class brings a new way of playing the game and new items become better to use than before, if you used all 3 different class weapons at one time. If you use only one build's items at a time, such as a pistol and a suit of necro armor, the pistol will be more effective in eliminating the enemy force.  I've been with this game since before 1.2, and I do have to say that it has gotten way more advanced over the years. There are plenty of items to be found and a large range of enemies that you will encounter over the time that you spend playing through this game.  I think this game is well worth the cost, and if it is on sale, I say you should buy it right there and then.  Edit: This review was made way before a lot of content was added to the game, so go check it out now for the best experience.",1,1

Especially once the curve sets in, you start feeling a sense of accomplishment for a mission success. And if you don't want to watch things you love die, you can make other people's soldiers die in multiplayer. As they say, 'War is a drug' and this game is a clear example.

Puzzles aren't insanely complex but they aren't boring either, they stay clever enough to keep you thinking.   The structure is a little weird as it's kind of open and you can sort of backtrack to older puzzles once you've acquired a certain mechanic/object etc etc. I like open-ended games, but I just think that it's easy to lose your way when navigating through different puzzles. I think I might prefer a more linear structure for this sort of game. But either way, the core gameplay is very solid and the puzzles do a great job of keeping you thinking.

240760,Wasteland 2,"So, if you take the term 'CRPG' really seriously and enjoy getting in fights about how modern RPGs aren't 'real' RPGs, and you wish it were still the late 1990s, this is a great game for you and you don't need to read the rest of my review.  On the other hand, if you enjoy isometric party-based RPGs but also might like to see some progress from the last 15 years or so of gaming history, Wasteland 2 is kind of a letdown precisely because of how stubbornly it emulates the UI fiddliness of Fallout 1/2. Get ready to remember which party member owns a shovel, switch to them, activate the shovel item, and wait while a progress bar fills up, every time you want to dig something up. And this isn't just shovels, it's *every specialized skill*. You're not realistically going to put together a party with more than one girl or guy who knows Safecracking or some other random ♥♥♥♥, but the game will never let you just click on the safe and have the one Safecracker open it.  The maps suffer from a similar level of fiddliness. You will have to memorize where in town that random questgiver is, or come back from a fetch quest to wander all over wondering where his shop is among a town of identical-looking dwellings. No quest markers is fine, I don't think that the player should have telepathic knowledge of where stuff is ahead of time, but when you're looking to turn in quests (and the characters would already know where shopkeeper X is) it's just a hassle. Isometric design also means that the level designers hide crates in places where you need to rotate the camera to find them ... which is fine, but after a while, it's not clever, it's just irritating to have to rotate the camera every time you enter a new room or potentially miss out on loot.  I could go on with examples of the weird sort of micromanagement that Wasteland 2 requires of the player (there are many more), but you get the point.  Bottom line, it feels like a game that came out in 2000, not 2014. If you're fine with this, go ahead and get it (but you probably already did). If you're not, and especially if you haven't played Fallout 1/2 to death, there's really no reason to play this instead of Fallout 1/2.",-1,0

333430,Sinking Island,"This game is a true piece of art, with wonderful storyline and absolutely amazing artwork, something I really like about Benoit Sokal's games. I'm a huge fan of Syberia series, and was really excited to play this one. The sceneries artwork is what really makes this game stand out. The colors, lighting and details are well thought through, together creating wonderful atmosphere to play in.  However, this game lacks details and realism in character animation, which made the game pretty hilarious and at the same time annoying to watch during the conversations. Another slightly frustrating feature is the random calls and hunger attacks on main character (especially frustrating when it's mid-conversation), which interrupt your progress.  But overall, I think it's a great and highly underrated adventure game.  ",1,0

Story is yet to be unfold but looks promising so far and I really enjoyed the gameplay mechanics. There are many ways to complete given tasks. AI is balanced so game stays fun and delivers a challenge at the same time. Enemies are communicating, reporting by radio when going to check a suspicious person or noises. Others are going to look for their missing colleague if he didn't return or radio back. Firefights might be easier, but try to earn S- rank at hard difficulty, that's a challenge!

379720,DOOM,"This is pretty much the real Doom 3, and the best FPS game in years besides Shadow Warrior. DOOM is all about staying on the move while strategizing how you're going to kill this wave of demons, the further you are in the game the harder it gets which means the more you have to use your brain. Every player will know this about the last wave of demons before you leave Hell to get back to Mars. There is a power up for Quad Damage to not pick it up until the giant red demons with horns come out at the end, finish off the little bit of smaller demons with the plasma rifle and then use the chainsaw to instant kill 1 out of the 2 big horned demons so you only have 1 demon left and just have fun with him.  -Now on with the pros and cons.  Pros:  -Badass soundtrack -Kickass Demons -weapon and suit upgrades -A true classic brought into the new generation -Finishing kills are always different going at different angles including when jumping on them from above -Very well worth your hard earned money which is rare for games these days  Cons:  -Multiplayer -chainsaw runs out of fuel fast and the fuel for it is rare to find.

By leveling up characters and a few other such things there is the abbility to earn I think 8 free packs too.

I started to like action RPGs after playing Elder Scrolls Skyrim, and as I finished the game I was looking for something similar, and well.. I found this game. I was not very sure about this game, it starts very bland but put a few hours to it and you would love it. the cities are bigger than the Skyrim's towns, its a free-to-explore, open world RPG and its massive! the story is very good and the game is addictive, a true solid RPG. there are a few problems though, some dialogues with NPCs are a little bland, the horse riding is stupid and the menus are a tad confusing. dont get me wrong, after a few hours you would start to enjoy it and it can be a good replacement for elder scrolls series. combat is very good and fun, magic is awesome, crafting and forging is very good and you have all the cool stuff like alchemy, enchanting (sort of!), upgarding weapons and customizing your character. there are guilds to join, and tons of quests to do. dungeons, demons, undead creatures, necromancers, everything you would want from a RPG. take my advice and buy it, you will love it as much as I do!  oh, and i almost forgot; this game has a true FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!",1,0

201830,Jurassic Park: The Game,"I died a lot. But I was ok with that. Sometimes the death animations were cool. If your aim is to get gold on every sequence, then you might find it incredibly frustrating, and not fun.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode. I died a lot and missed a lot of quick time events, but the game was pretty forgiving about it.  I’m playing on OSX 10.8.5 and my controller doesn’t work, at all. There doesn’t seem to be any options to switch to a controller from a keyboard, either. The game runs pretty smoothly most of the time, but occasionally it will just suddenly crash to desktop. One time the game seemed to get kind of confused, and I had to force quit the game.  The shadows look really pixelated, and I have the settings all the way up.  The game is an odd sort of mix of quick time events and simple puzzles. There’s not much of a challenge, and the quick time events can be a little frustrating, but the visuals and the music and the vocals and sound design are all masterfully done.  To me, it’s more of an interactive experience, than a game, and it’s an experience that I enjoyed.  There is one choice that matters and it comes in the last sequence of the game. It doesn't matter much, but it will determine which of 2 endings you receive.",1,0

264730,Deadly 30,"Important- This game had some serious performance issues for me until I followed this FAQ.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=260668911  Now everything runs smoothly. It's still an annoying bug for many though, and I hope the devs make a permanent fix.  Deadly 30 is a blend of tower defense and run-and-gun zombie shooter. Very simple mechanics to the point of being a time-waster, but entertaining with a somewhat unusual flow of gameplay that I'd love to see more of in the future. Basically, your time is split into days and each day consists of a morning, afternoon, dusk, and night. Your choices during each phase will dictate whether you can survive to the next day. The first two phases are relatively peaceful, a time spent upgrading your base, weapons, and abilities then venturing out into the lands surrounding your base to collect supplies from enemies or scrappable structures. All of your effort is put toward becoming strong enough to survive that night. You can also run into allies that will join your cause. There is an element of luck as you never know if that day will yield plentiful resources and spawn needed allies, lack of both can result in some very hectic nights. In later chapters, dusk is usually spent fighting off enemies as you hurry back to the base to hopefully upgrade some stuff in time for the night phase. The nights of the game are spent facing a giant slew of zombies, ideally you make it back to base in time to set and upgrade some blockades to serve as a distraction while you pick them off zombies by the hundreds. As you successfully complete each night you can gain access to new upgrades, level up, and view tiny and very goofy cut-scenes. There are also a wide variety of zombie types that are unlocked almost every other day. This is a short game but the frequency of new upgrades/enemies/weapon types are regular and keep the pace running well.   For me this game is a lot of fun in the short bursts it can be played, but too shallow and simple to have real longevity. It's disappointing to discover for example, that the various explorable areas are all the same but for palette swaps, and don't contain any defining unique features like bosses, hidden areas, or unique items- content is plunked down randomly.   At the end of the day, the concept is what remains compelling about Deadly 30 and is one I'd like to see in future games. I'm a big fan of games that integrate day and night systems in meaningful way, time management features make every moment count, the 'just one more day' flow of gameplay keeps things addictive, and the element of randomness to each day is not unlike the joy of each run in roguelikes. The difficulty of Deadly 30 is on the low side though. While death comes easily and some zombie types are colossally strong, the game is pretty lenient on failure. Each successful night is autosaved and you can repeat a failed day. If you really run into an unbeatable situation, starting from a new game saves a lot of progress and should result in a much more success.  This game has been on sale or bundled a lot lately, it's worth the money in my opinion but I hope future updates or sequels expand significantly on the depth of the world, and strategic options and aspects to help offset the repetitive and monotonous nature of the combat. Overall, a fun and strangely relaxing shooter/survival hybrid.",1,0

237740,Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures,"Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is a 2D, 8 bit retro style 'torture' platformer. After a brief tutorial level to kickoff the game, it opens up to eight selectable levels. A few are far easier than others. There is a lot of parody going on here. Levels reminiscent of old Nintendo games like Castlevania, Metroid, Super Mario Bros 2 and Zelda 2. You'll even find an 8 bit parody of dirty Atari games. Once you complete those eight, then the final LJN style level gets revealed. It is all based on the comedy from the Angry Video Game Nerd web series that has been around for a decade. Its a good game that doesn't offer any unique features that aren't found in other Nintendo games. If you're looking for something fresh and original gameplay wise, you won't find it here.  The game plays a lot like Mega Man. Jump, shoot (with no autofire), duck and use a special item. The only difference is there is 8 way shooting like Contra. You can even hold the trigger to plant your feet so you don't walk as you aim diagonal. The items are few and far between. The tutorial level will walk you through all them. Glitch gremlin that I think kills everything killable on screen? Seven hours into the game and I still don't know for sure. Super Mecha Death Christ definitely kills everything on screen. Things like a rock that do little to no damage. Its just in the game so the Nerd can make a joke. The Nerd can even pick up a superscope weapon that does more damage, but one hit and you've lost it. A lot of times you'll find it in areas with unkillable enemies.  Even as a torture platformer, the game isn't that difficult. Timing is key. More than missing a jump, its missing a jump at the wrong time might get you hit and you'll fall in a pit. Each level is around 10 minutes. You have health measured in beer. Pick up a beer to restore your health. On easy you can walk into enemies with no regard for your life. Normal difficulty and up you have to have skills to not die from health loss. Each enemy causes you to get knocked back which becomes deadly if a pit is around. With that being said, the majority of deaths come from death blocks. Mega Man 2 had spikes, AVGN has deathblocks. These are everywhere! Some are in the ground. Somme are moving. Some are on and off with a timer. Some appear only when you get close to them. If you're not paying attention, to where you step, you're dead!  Nin-Toasters get used as checkpoints. These are pretty frequent. When you die, you respawn, but not after seeing a death screen with a randomly generated death phrase that usually involves an animal, a fluid and an body hole. You cannot turn off these death screens. It could be to hide a loading screen. You need to see it for a few seconds before pushing jump to get back to the action. Most torture platformers just drop you right back into the action.  Each level is pretty straight forward, but still allows for exploration here and there. You'll even find three extra characters to play as. Each has their own style and can be toggled on the fly with the shoulder bumpers. Mike has a high Luigi jump and can use a short range light sabre to break through walls that get highlighted as you draw near. He also makes invisible platforms appear. Couch Guy has a wave attack from his guitar that will go through blocks when the Nerd's gun can't. His jump is short, so he's better for SHMUP sections of the game. Finally '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' has a double jump and a short range arced attack, but can't jump as high as the Nerd. He's good for accessing different areas. For the most part, these extra characters are only used for finding secret areas, that have cameos from other ScrewAttack friends along with plenty of beer and 1-ups.  The enemies feel diverse, but there isn't a huge variety. Each level swaps out enemy sprites. High bouncing enemies, enemies that attract to you, wave pattern enemies, floor spikes that shoot up, hovering enemies, circular flying unkillable fireballs and so on. Each level has its own unique big enemies. Snowmen that belch giant snowballs. Giant turd balls that spit dookie at you in Hell. Axe throwers in the Castlevania level. Each enemy's death had particle effects that felt satisfying. At the end of each level is of course a boss, straight from AVGN's history of evil. Jason Vorhees, Satan, Dr. Jekyll / Mister Hyde, General Custer and so on. Most of the bosses just fly in a figure eight pattern.  Unlike most torture platformers, there was dynamic gameplay. Going from a platformer to a sidescrolling SHMUP. Riding down a hill one a dead corpse, streaking blood behind you. Hopping on a giant laser shark and tearing through lava. These were all a lot of fun to break up the levels. Even with each level having its own theme, there were things gimmick wise to make them stand out. The Castlevania level has a series of timed on and off death blocks. The dirty Atari level has bouncing platforms under your feet. The snow level had ice to slide on. The Zelda 2 level had keys to unlock doors. The haunted level has moving block platforms like Super Mario World and darkness outside of a short illumination around the Nerd. The Mega Man future level had timed laser beams and timed on / off platforms. It was able to keep the challenges dynamic.  It is no doubt a good game for fans that like Mega Man's gameplay. There are just little things that get in the way. The text box at the bottom of the screen with the Nerd talking is a distraction and obscures the action. In fact, the entire game is just a distraction. There are laser lights panning through some levels. Things flying everywhere. Even a vomit inducing waterfall ala Super Mario Bros 2. Half a dozen fireballs flying in a circle, bouncing on platforms, while enemies float toward you! Its all very busy, but that's probably to keep your eyes off the death blocks! The comedy also misses its mark, but I feel a lot of comedy games aren't that funny. Maybe its lacking the Nerd's delivery. Its just not as funny in text form when I'm too busy playing the game to read it.  Playing normal mode first took 2 hours for the first 8 levels and 4 hours for the final level. I sank around 100 lives just for the final boss. Then I discovered how to plant my feet by holding the trigger to shoot diagonal without walking. Normal difficulty gives you unlimited continues and 30 lives. I felt the intensity when I had died 10 times on a boss and I was coming to my final life to beat him. Easy difficulty gives you more health and unlimited lives ensuring you'll get through the game. There are higher difficulties, but normal was enough for me. I have a feeling you can complete easy difficulty in under 2 hours.  To summarize, its the best AVGN game you could hope for. Easy difficulty makes it so everyone can complete the game. If it wasn't for easy difficulty I wouldn't recommend it. I'd recommend it more for fans of old Nintendo games than AVGN fans. If you're into 8-bit Nintendo games, especially Mega Man. Get it. Also take note that 50% of players have the 100 deaths achievement. So does that mean on easy mode they beat it in under 100 lives or did they just give up and not complete it?",1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Evolve caught my attention right from the day of its announcement. I followed this game for months, living off a trickle of previews and videos; I never had the privilege of being able to play the beta. I wanted this game so badly, never even having tried it, that I paid 700 rand for it before launch. And you know what?...  It was worth it.  Because, good god, it's a terrifying, exhilirating, stalking, stomping beast of a game. Evolve looks great, but more importantly it feels great - it feels great to run and leap for your life through alien jungles, to be this huge and powerful thing and pounce upon your prey, beating them down without mercy. It also feels great to be in a team hunting this huge and powerful thing, following a trail of footprints, broken bodies and carnage while dodging lesser dangers and watching each other's backs, until the time comes for a final showdown where the strength of your teamwork is put to the test. The best part is, until you're in the thick of it, it's impossible to know who's hunting who.  Evolve is addictive fun and it knows how to make my heart beat like crazy; it makes we want to cheer when I win a hard-earned victory, and it makes me want to try again when I fail. I don't care that there's a bunch of stupidly expensive skins there for people who want to advertise that they have money to burn - quite refreshingly, in fact, this game hasn't tried to sell me anything since I bought it, which works out great because it came packed with content that I've yet to see and I can't see it getting old anytime soon. On top of that, it's easy to find a match whenever I feel like playing, the players are usually considerate and helpful and I've yet to be insulted or trolled by anyone.  I. LOVE. THIS. GAME. Play it and, well... Evolve.",1,0

There still isn't a competently balanced difficulty setup, every civilization runs the same strategy, with very little regard for leader identity. Leader identity should be a core focus, but it's just ignored. Civ 6 promised a new Casus Belli system, which has turned out to be just new ways to be declared a war mongerer by everyone else. You can now be invited into a joint war and then declared a war mongerer by the civilization that asked you to join the joint war. The company in-charge has no public-face, which means they don't value their gamers. I wonder where the creativity went in game design.",-1,1

228280,Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition,"To begin with, I still declare Baldur's Gate to be one of my favourite games of all time. I have been playing it since the early 2000's before the Enhanced Edition and thoroughly enjoy the series.  The original game was riddled with bugs, compatibility issues and multiple other large problems for modern gaming and a remake of the game was very promising. The Enhanced Edition added multiple new quests, classes and boosted the level cap whilst also acting as a major bug fix. This was very well recieved but it still wasn't perfect, just very good. The remake kept closely to the original with some neccesary changes and fixes. The repairment and ease of the multiplayer mode was the cherry on top, allowing for groups of friends to adventure together in a wonderful story and detailed world. The added areas, game mode and voice actors were unsettling at first, but easy to warm up to and even enjoy the variety before you.  The remake of the sequel had near enough the same changes allowing it to be a must-buy for owners of the first game.  However, Siege of Dragonspear.... This DLC came with a list of bug fixes, UI changes and all other changes that completely ruined my experience of the game. They somehow managed to make the game look uglier than a half-orc and act as smart as a goblin. The AI now is only useful in non-stressful multi-opponent fights, of which there are few in the DLC, and they destroyed the multiplayer mode to be non-functioning for a lot of people. This coupled with the completely game braking bugs that you can find within the first ten minutes of gameplay have essentially taking the Baldur's Gate that we know and love and turned it into a small pile of trash. Not to say it isn't a good game, the DLC's storyline is good and takes a large chunk of time, achievement hunting is both humorous and fun and a couple of the new NPC's are funny and useful. But it is far from the game we all fell in love with. tl;dr It is a great game but riddled with bugs, inconsistencies in most aspects and the DLC is only worth it for the achievments and die-hard story fans.",1,0

She was really into SNES and Genesis as a kid all the way until Halo on the original XBox, but since then she sort of backed out of gaming. We are both huge Jurassic Park fans and I thought this would be a fun game to play together. So glad I got it. It's been a while since I have been able to play a game with my wife where we lose track of time and need to make ourselves turn it off.  The game is surprisingly all movies in the franchise. In the begenning you get to play wither Jurassic Park 1 or Jurassic World. After beating JP1, you unlock JP2! Very excited when that happened!   The game plays like most Lego games, and borrows all audio from the movies (at least in the cases of JP1 &amp; JP2) and for a huge JP fan, this is actually a plus. They stick the films rather well and but with a light hearted twist. You'll see what I mean during the 'SHOOT HER!!' scene.  I have no problem buying this at full price.

282140,SOMA,"Loved it. The horror comes from making difficult choices that only you can rationalise and justify to yourself.   Good: Great immersion, setting, atmosphere, level design, aesthetics, sound, interesting story. Empathised quite a lot with the characters, present and absent. To me everything seemed to make sense (in the context of the game).  OK: Adequate graphics. Not as pretty as Alien: Isolation, but definitely good enough for the job. Definitely did not get boring or drag out too long. Some of the puzzles, enemies &amp; exploration can be confusing/frustrating but I think it stays within the bounds of what makes sense. Fairly short, but it's of the 'short and sweet' flavour. You may feel that your choices have no impact on the game, but the point is that your choices should have an impact on  you .  Bad: Some voice acting feels flat or maybe not as expressive as could be. MC has a fixed perspective on things which disagreed with my own perspective. Some screen effects do make your eyes hurt.",1,0
248570,Toribash,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,1

212680,FTL: Faster Than Light,"If there's one game that thoroughly deserves to be paid more than ten bucks for, it'd be FTL. As it stands, the pricetag is amazing. It's a Roguelike and anyone who's ever been of the old cardboard and wood persuasion will know of the infamous Galaxy Truckers boardgame, which it is oddly reminiscent of. When you just start playing the rounds won't take too long, ten to twenty minutes or so. But as you actually become skilled and gain a feeling for how it works, the games will drag on for hours on end. This is a slower Roguelike, as evinced by Ben Prunty's absolutely-lovely-beyond-words OST. But dear lord will you have fun.  You're going to be given command of the Kestrel, pushed from a giant battle to warn earth of the impending fleet the enemy is sending after their resounding victory. The game allows you to re-crhisten the ship though, and the UEFC 'Psyentific' has had her maiden voyage about four hundred times by now - as has its crew.  The poor thing comes with only limited fuel and supplies, and it straddles the line between risk and reward the same way your crazy ex girlfriend always used to. Are you gonna make that extra jump or two to send aid to that HELP beacon that keeps blipping? Are you going to ignore your conscience, play it safe and just head for the sector's warp gate? They might have what you need. You're low on fuel and they could just have a busted thruster pack with a full tank of space JP-8. Maybe they have ammunition for your missile pods? Extra drones they don't need? Oh man maybe they have  weapons .  So you make the jump, and you're about to present yourself as the saviour of all things research vehicles, and    OH IT'S SODDING PIRATES  ",1,0
415030,One More Dungeon," A fun  LITTLE  game, don't expect a grand adventure going into this.    6/10    Worth the price?:  $5 isn't asking much, but it would'nt hurt to wait til a sale.

272040,KAMI,"Full review:  http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/kami-game-review/   KAMI is probably one of the more unique puzzle games that I’ve played as of late. The game has you folding paper, origami-style, to solve puzzles. The game’s title is the Japanese word for paper and I still have no idea how to pronounce it (I’ve been saying it like ‘CAM-E’).  The method used to solve each puzzle is why this game is so unique. Each puzzle starts you off with a square sheet of paper, much like origami, with this piece of paper being covered in small triangles of varying colors. Your objective is to make the entire sheet of paper one solid color in as little clicks as possible. There’s a color palette at the bottom of each puzzle and its your choice in deciding what color the end result should be, with that hopefully being the color netting you the least amount of clicks.  When you click on any triangle in the puzzle, any other triangle of the same color connected to the clicked triangle will change into the color you have selected. This is a bit difficult to explain, so I encourage you to look at videos, etc. This color-changing mechanic is accomponied by a neat-looking animation as well, which I would describe as a sea of paper-folding triangles.  The game’s major fault lies in the amount of content offered. I wish there were more puzzles to do, as there’s only 63. The game is $4 (on Steam) though, so that may be the reason. I ran out of puzzles rather quickly, although that can probably be attributed to the fact that I went for the bare minimum ranking in each puzzle, “okay”, instead of opting to go for the “perfect” ranking in each. There is another ranking as well, known as “fail”, and I’m sure you can figure what that means on your own.  The game’s difficulty curve is fantastic. Slowly increasing, but not to a completely frustrating point. If you’ve got time to kill, then I highly recommend KAMI. Although it may be short, it’s well-worth the unique experience. Oh, it’s also worth mentioning that the game does not fully display in widescreen, but instead has some rather thin black bars to the left and right. No idea why it wasn’t optimized for widescreen, wish it had been.",1,0

214770,Guacamelee! Gold Edition,"Easily one of the best indie games i've ever purchased. If an action platformer, a beat em up, and metroidvania had a child this would be the child. In this game you fight and grapple the enemies, as well as using moves you unlock throughout the games. All of your moves can combo together. For example, I can use my upward punch, then jump up and rooster claw(upward attack that shoots you up too. This is useful all game to help you platform as well.), attack them multiple times, then either groundpound them, headbutt them away, or grapple them and follow up with one of my throws. I could always piledrive my enemy, kick them 20 feet away, or do a deadly suplex to help wipe out the enemies that might await below me.  The enemies have a good variety, even tho I wish it had more. I felt like with a little more variety amongst the enemies, this game would have been so much more fun.  For now, I'll give it a 8.5/10. I truly recommend this gem of a game, on sale or off.    ",1,0

379720,DOOM,"Pure FPS fun.   Going in I had reservations about the glory kills but my fears were quickly dismissed and I'm pretty sure I played the entire game with a big stupid grin on my face with frequent outbursts of maniacle laughter.  This game knows what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, it embraces everything that made the DOOM series legendary and builds upon it with a soundtrack that is one of the most enjoyable I've listened to in a long time. The only flaw I can think of is the map controls are a bit annoying to use but it's such a minor niggle you should not let that put you off. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing epic.   Demonic invasion in progress!  What are you waiting for? ",1,0

331470,Everlasting Summer,"this game...holy ♥♥♥♥ this game. Usually I'm not a fan of reading or virtual stories but holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. I say this because of the immersion and character developement of the different people around you during those seven days. This game has some incredible story telling worthy or ranking above and beyond Life is Strange and The Walking Dead. There is also some amazing content and hidden story for the theorists of the world to uncover about this game like: where you are, why you are here and what this place is. The game also had some very creepy and dark themes to it like the old camp grounds which you visit on day 4. The diversity of all the characters and seeing them all thrown into one place just made the 'game' so much more enjoyable.  Cons- Of course no game is without its problems so here are a some of the problems I found. dificult to find specific endings for characters alone, the game has some incredible points in the story which it doesn't elaborate in too much detail and I found it difficult to 'like' some of the characters introduced.  Overall I highly reccomend this game to EVERYONE even if its just to try it out or 'go out on a limb.' the game portrays and excellent contrast with the Russian setting compared to Russia at the time. This game is PERFECT for anyone even if you're not a fan of these types of games seeing as its a much more relaxed and calm experience which can still get very tense or creepy. So go download this game and PLAY IT, I cannot reccommend this game anymore",1,0

No choice is between evil and good. And no choice is forcefully gray and morally ambiguous the way BioWare does it. Choices are complex and have deep consequences.  The only real problem is it gets too easy by the end.

359320,Elite Dangerous,"This game has great potential but its design and the way it is built right now is a joke. Extremely unfriendly for new players and kind of empty. What I like about it: The graphics, the fast loading times, the freedom it gives you and the abiltiy to do what you want, the control with a joystick and thruster and space battles (it just is fun).  What I don't like...well:  Steep learning curve - it will take you a while to learn most of the things in this game. Almost nothing is explained. Missions are extremely vague, bugged, and annoying. Find and kill X, Location: Space. Great.  Another example Find X Canisters of Whatever. You find them but the mission can't continue because they're apparently not the ones you need, even though you got them from the system it said.  There's no real content, lots of grinding. Little to no player interactions, no guilds, no voice chats except on Wings. No voice chats on the AI, they communicate through text messages. Really not immersive.  You get pulled out of hyperspace on almost every trip, it becomes a nuissance after the first 10 times. You get stopped, you destroy the idiot, you continue. Just a waste of time. Some stations and destinations are really ♥♥♥♥ing far away from each other, 150 000Ls away takes you 10 minutes of sitting doing nothing at all. And it's apparently another star with other planets, so basically another system. Why can't I just ♥♥♥♥ing warp there?  Coop and Wing play is a joke. Frequent disconnects. Game lags. Your Wing suddenly disappears. The game freezes for no reason.  You can't play coop in open play, only private groups, what's the ♥♥♥♥ing purpose then? Did I mention players are rare? It's mostly a single player or coop game (when it works).  All in all it was worth 13 euros for the time I spent in it, but it could've been a lot more pleasant. Not worth more than 20 eur, even with expansions. Oh, and they charge separately for ship paint jobs and other crap. Not cool.",-1,0

Emily is Away is a short (I completed it in about thirty minutes), feel-good game that makes you think and savor the moment. It has five different chapters of the game, the first chapter set in your last year of high school, the last chapter set in your last year of college. In this game you unfortunately must play as a male, Emily being female, and you face the ups and downs of friendship. Although you do have choices in this game, they do not seem to affect the ending of this game. Overall I recommend this game. ",1,0

506140,Shop Heroes,"I missed the launch day for Steam on 15th and got on the 16th, first time on and spent 4 straight hours. Later that day spent another 2 straight hours and 6 more hours on the 17th. Now the 18th spent 2 more straight hours playing... It's only 6AM, I have so much more time.  The game is simple, a ton of multitasking and nothing to stop you from continuesly playing if you know how to micromanage. Those straight hours of playing I did was that short because I forced myself to stop and take a break.  You play the role of a mayor for a city ( starting out is pretty much a village) and you try to build up everything by making investments with the gold you earn through sending heroes on quests to gather tiny bit of gold and materials, having smiths, leatherworkers, crafters of all sorts making equipment for customers, and finally making sales through the market.  Some say 'It's a waiting game'. Yeah if you can't micromanage you will get stuck in long waits.  Example...  You have 12 wood and 12 iron. The first customer wants a 'Maul' (costs 5 wood[58sec]), second customer wants a 'Sledgehammer' (8 wood, 2 shiny gems[1min 46sec]). You don't have the shiny gems nor enough wood to make both weapons.  You can...  A) Craft the 'Maul' and wait over your resources to refill and craft the 'Sledgehammer' next. OR B) Craft 2 'Mauls' saving 2 wood but it takes 1min 56sec.  So you spend 10 more seconds of waiting but have 2 wood left over for say crafting 2 'Clubs' which is 5secs each.  Not every customer will come in all at once but one after another or a min after the first so you can already be crafting one item and another customer steps in so you start that one then 2 more come in and you start theirs then the first is done so you cash in on it. This constant switch can be endless if you know how to MICROMANAGE.  That is just dealing with the customer now you sent some heroes on a few quests that from the first 2 quests take around 5-10mins. If you micromanage this will fly by.  So you keep track of...  - Resources (early on is Wood, Iron, Leather, or if you chose druid as your third worker herbs) - Stockpile of weapons and armour - Heroes on Quests - Current wait time on equipment - What customer to sell to first or what to sell to them  The customers alone have some features you should keep track of and figure out how you want to deal with on a buisness level. Discount, Surcharge, Compliment, Refuse, Suggest, and From Trade.  Discount : You lower price you request for the item you are selling to them (Gain more energy) Surcharge : You charge more for the item you are selling to them (Lose more energy) Compliment : This is seemingly random, you may gain or lose energy with this Refuse : You turn down their request and lose or gain nothing, Takes longer for them to return. Suggest : Suggest a different item to the customer (Lose energy) From Trade : You can buy the requested equipment from the market but can cost more then the sale  With these factors now you run into points such as...  I can't craft what he wants but I can make the next best thing which will lose energy but if I discount it then I make a profit of energy and still make some gold.  You also can buy equipment racks that increase how much energy you get from selling those types of equipment on the rack...  So if the customer wanted a Sledgehammer and you only could make him a Maul but you also have a Mace equipment rack then you can Surcharge the Maul and still make a profit of energy or lose no energy at all with the customer and you make a great profit!  Important bit 'Energy' Ah that sounds like a restriction most facebook games have that control how long you get to play so you are forced either to wait hours or pay with real money to continue. NO! It doesn't work that way here.  You have several factors I just covered here that will allow you to always have energy! If you just sell the items the customer wants you lose and gain no energy and crafting COSTS NO ENERGY!",1,1

I played this game being lured in by the description because it sounds okay, but no, you will be lucky if you can even experience the awful gameplay because no sane person would even attempt to paly the game more than 15 minutes without shutting the damn game off.

234190,Receiver,"Huh. Really very cool. So this is an FPS, but with a little twist. Basically the core mechaninc behind this game is reloading your gun. You don't just have 'reoald' bound to 'R'. You have to remove the clip, fill it back up with rounds and re-insert it. Make sure you have the safety off, then pull the slide back to put a round in the chamber.

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Keep in mind, i have finished the game after writing this review. This game is broken. If you hate games that feel like they havent been tested, then stay away. There are countless glitches in this game. The controls for keyboard and mouse suck, but you might get used to them, even though your cursor is always on your screen. The framerate is not great and gets horrible (like below 15) when you get to Seath.   Its community defend it with the stupidest phrases. 'its not meant to be played on keboard and mouse' then why is it on pc? if they would have made the cursor be able to dissapear and make the target switching less sensitive, it wouldnt be as bad. 'if you dont want your frames to drop, use the 60fps mod' if you need to mod the game to get it to work properly then your game has a problem. Its hard, yes, sometimes stupidly hard. I can respect a difficult game, but diffictulty shouldnt come from bad controls and framerate issues, it should come only from the game itself,   The lock on system favors the strangest targets. It wont lock to the person in fron of you, it will target the person down the stairs and behind a wall that you cant see, and if you're on keyboard and mouse (you can actually play without the mouse, but i wanted to use it) slightly moving the mouse will cause targets to switch. With multiple enemies, this can cause your camera to freakout. Speaking of the camera, it suffers from what most 3rd person games suffer from, not being able to see whats in fron of you because the camera is blocked. This is hell on the decent to blightown.   The random invasions are very annoying as well. apparently very high level people still camp lower level areas to invade any possible new players to prey on them, cause, well you know, its the internet.  You can occasionaly find yourself having fun in this and the game gets much easier the farther it goes, and if you know what to get, (or just constanly explore like me) it can be more fun. Pyromancy, Havel armor set, and the black knights sword= a walking tank that no boss stands a chance from.  Its dangerous to go alone so take this piece of advice, dont play it. I did, had a bit of fun but i just needed to kill time. I 'got gud' played that 'dank souls', 'tried jumping' and for the love of god saw 'praise the sun' at least 100 times. ♥♥♥♥ the sun, ♥♥♥♥ the sun and its covenant in particular- Sicerely The Moon.

317820,Guild of Dungeoneering Ultimate Edition,"I ought to say that my first impressions on this game are great!!!!!.  For more detailed stuff, just read on! XD  - Pros The game itself is based on simple rules.  Its very intuitive. Uses a lot of strategy. There arent many death penalties.  Its REALLY fun. Its challenging.   - Cons This game, (the way I saw it anyway) depends a LOT on luck.  Even though the graphics are fun ans really suit the game, They should improve it a bit.   8/10   ---DETAILS---  This is a card-strategy game with elements of RPG, delver and dungeon building. The story is prety fun so far and the characters are funny, they actually made me giggle a few times.    Lets split it a bit.  Soundtrack: Simply awesome. Everytime a hero dies, wins a dungeon or when you start the game, the music just blows my mind. It really fits the atmosphere of the game! Congratulations to the developers! 10/10  Graphics: Pretty cool, but not awesome. Its kinda of repetitive, even though whenever you equip a new equipment to a hero it changes the display, everything else stays the same. 8/10  Gameplay: The gameplay consists on 3 parts:  1. Building your guild. The gold you get from dungeons you use to upgrade your guild, allowing you to get more heroes, blessings, different loot in dungeons. You can also check your graveyard and trophy room. Nice features, good mechanics to upgrade, but the visual effects and the higher tier upgrades cost are kinda of lame. 9/10  2. Building the dungeon. At the beggining of the 'round' you receive 5 cards. There are creatures cards, dungeos area cards and treasure cards. You can put 3 of them into play. The idea is to use these 3 cards to build the dungeon, place enemies and treasures for you hero to find. The cards you get are mostly based on luck. Wich SUCKS. Sometimes you only get stupid cards, like 3 areas that only connect to 1 area and 2 creatures that can kick your ♥♥♥ as encounters. I got to say that dependiong entirely on luck kinda bummed me out. 7/10.  3. Movement of the hero and battles. You dont control the hero movement, he ALWAYS take the shortest route to complete the dungeon objective. Easy to understand. The harder the dungeon, the longer the dungeon you must create for him to get there, but the cards you receive to create the dungeon are random, remember? This can SUCK sometimes. Ok, now for the battle system. Its a card battle system. Each of your heroes start with a deck of cards that is the standard for that 'class'. You CANNOT change the deck before the dungeon. It's ALWAYS the same. When you win a battle, you will get some sort of equipment. The equipments will then add cards/give more health to your character. All the equipment is lost once you complete/fail a dungeon. So you always start with the same deck. The battle themselves are fun, but sometimes EXTREMELY frustrating.  You start the battle with 3 cards and you can see the card that you enemy is going to play, with that you can choose the best card for the ocasion. The battles are in 'real time' by that I mean that its not turn based. When you chose your card, yours and the enemies card are used at the same time, unless you use a quick card, wich makes you use it first. Once again, everything is based on luck, but that is to be expected, since its a card based battle, but it kinda takes a bit of the charm of the game. Since it is luck based you can be defeated by some stupid monsters, that you placed and was sure that was going to defeat it. 8/10  Gamplay overall: 24/30  ",1,0

214560,Mark of the Ninja,"I was so pleased that Klei made this...thing... This is the best platformer to come IN YEARS and one of my personal best games of ALL TIME (yyyyyyyeah...)! Graphically the game is amazing, the graphic style is a cartoony-like art style, it's so fun, cutscenes looks particularly amazing! Absolutely shockingly beautiful! I hate watching cutscenes and skip them mostly, but Mark of The Ninja is so different, I watched them all! They are funny, character animations and so good and cool! I love it! Usually indie games f*ck up story right? Yeah Mark of the Ninja nailed storyline! It's SO good! You have a huge twist in the end that makes you think about everything you've done until then and it made me sit in my chair for 10 minutes strait looking at my damn screen thinking which ending I should pick (there are 2 endings...). It's quite mindblowing I must say, last time I felt like that was with Bioshock Infinite (Infinite mindblew me a bit more though :P). Gameplay is also stellar, the map layout/design is incredible, you can take so many routes to reach your objective, there are so many different paths! It's incredible how they pulled this off! The controls are also amazingly fluid and responsive, unlike most stealth games, a sight for sore eyes! The game is also pure stealth-like, and by this I mean you can finish the game without killing anyone (except 'boss' targets, and even some you can choose not to kill, rather steal their info or something like that, really genius!). The game also has a bit of an RPG like system, where you get scored based on your level performance (don't worry it's much better done than Hitman: Absolution!), you also have some collectibles to find and objectives during the mission (like destroy 20 light in this mission or get to the end of the level without getting detected), very well thought and Future Soldier-like with I really loved in Future Soldier! It adds replayability! Anyways, with all those collectibles, scores, challenges completed you will be awarded a certain number of points (up to 9) where you can spend on new kill moves, tricks, hiding techniques, new equipment to use, like distraction flares, mines, etc. It's well thought and it encourages various styles of gameplay (between a murderous SOB to a sneaky pacifist, everything works!) Voice acting is also pretty good and you care about the characters, they have a personality and makes you get really into this ninja clan your character belongs to and what's happening and figure it all out. I though I covered pretty much everythign, the amazing skill point system, the amazing story, the amazing art style, the amazing character development, the amazing sound quality, the amazing and varied gameplay, the amazing and fluid controls! I think that the only think left to say is that there is a New Game +! To add even more replayablity! New Game + isn't shallow like in most games, hell no! Here it's fully implemented, your FOV is much lower (if you want to see if there a guard or something behind you you really need to turn back, if you want to see if there's someone below you, you need to look down, etc. This makes it a lot harder, besides the fact that in NG+ you die in one shot! so run like hell if you get spotted!  It's right now 14,99€ it's totally worth it at that full price, at any discount it's a steal! Like I said I was going to score a game if it was an amazing-truly-exceptional exception and Mark of the Ninja is EXACTLY THAT:  10/10! :D Get it now! It truly deserves the Metacritic score it got: 91 for an indie game? Wow It's the same as Fallout 3, more than any CoD game, more than The Witcher 2! It's not as good as Fallout 3 xD but it's really one of the games of the year and like I said one of the best games of all time. This IS true stealth! and like Destructoid said: 'Let it stand as the benchmark by which all stealth games are now measured.'  Or like GameInformer: 'Tense, strategic, and hard to put down, Mark of the Ninja is one of the welcome surprises of the year.'   Again! 10/10 on my list! I love it!",1,0

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"The followup of the already amazing game Demon's Souls takes what was great in that game and improves it, except the pvp system. Bosses and enemy design fits perfectly in the dark and abandoned world. The areas are over all brilliantly designed (yes, even Blighttown). Sadly the developers ran out of time finishing the game, which lead to less polished areas in the late game (Lost Izalith for example). The DLC made up for that though and we get to enjoy three of the best bosses in the entire series with Artorias being in my personal top 3.  Looking at some parts of that game that were rather frustrating (I'm talking to you Anor Londo archers on the roofs) it can be easy to just give up and not touch Dark Souls ever again (Ornstein and his Companion may be responsible for a lot of rage quits). Still that's part of the game and you as the player have to overcome the challenges and that's what makes this game so amazing. Dark Souls 1 was my first Souls experience ever, and oh boy did I die a lot. Still I never gave up and now I consider myself a very good PvE player (I suck at pvp)  I recommend this game to everybody who wants a true challenge and is not afraid of dying again and again :3",1,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I'll start by saying it's a little rough around the edges currently in terms of polish, however as a total package, Chivalry is a really nice multiplayer game— especially for fans of the medieval theme.  Like many great multiplayer games out there, Chivalry is something that's easy enough to pick up, but hard to master. Combat in this game is deceptively deep, which proved to be a pleasant (albeit frustrating initially) surprise to me based on my premature impressions. Going into a fight flailing a weapon won't cut it in most situations. Timing plays a huge part both offensively and defensively, and learning how to play the different classes and effectively utilizing and countering each weapon in the arsenal is imperative to success.  So if you're a fan of multiplayer combat games and are looking for something fresh and unique from your everyday shooter, Chivalry is a good buy, and something that can provide countless hours of entertainment with the promise of free content patches in the future as well.",1,0
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"Returning to this game from Fallout 4 is dissapointing. Not for this game, but for the latter. This game seems to be better in nearly every aspect. Fallout 4 has better gun-play and character animations, but that's about the only thing it has above New Vegas. In New Vegas, the role playing elements are far better, the speech options are actually varied providing reason to upgrade skill paths more frequently such as speech, and even lack of upgrading the intelligence branch impacts speech choices. The graphics are subjective, but they seem better in New Vegas as well, targeting a more realistic look as opposed to Fallout 4 that changed to a more cartoonish look. There are also more gameplay aspects, such as repairing weaponry and equipment. Buy this game, it's easily worth the full asking price, and a steal during any sale.",1,0

227580,"10,000,000","There aren’t too many puzzle games that do what this one does.

Now, I don’t know about you, but there aren’t too many puzzle games that come to mind that can check off those same boxes. This game does something very special: it makes you want to solve puzzles, not just to get to the next level, but to progress in every sense of the term. Your character will gain access to better weapons, shields, and even potions which help all help customize the experience. 10,000,000 does all of this while being wrapped in a very basic pixel-art shell with music that is guaranteed to be stuck in your head for days.",1,0

205100,Dishonored,"I give this game a 3 out of 5. It gets some of the things right (like the story) and some things wrong (the blatant feminist propaganda throughout the game, and the occational spawning/despawning enemy).  (I will bring up the DLCs in their own section after the main review.)    SPAWNING / DESPAWNING  While many players get confused over guards filling in eachothers patrol routes, there are actual spawning/despawning in the game, which frustrates stealthy players who prefers to stake out their targets first, and/or players who use Dark Vision that is supposed to detect people through walls.  Examples:  - In the first level, after blowing up the wall, choking a guard will make an extremely high sound, and spawn guards from empty places, that will come to the rescue at a ridiculous speed. Every time you take one down, another one will appear. There is thus no way to rander all these guards unconscious.  - On the next level, at the warehouses behind the building, there's a scene where an overseer gets executed. All these three people are set to despawn as soon as you don't look at them anymore. One of them can open a door, you can look away, and when you look back, the door will even be closed.  - In the tower, a whale oil guard will spawn out of nowhere, dangerously close to a body storage room, and his route will almost ensure that he will spot you before you spot him.  - Swarms of rats can spawn on numerous occations, which requires you to sometimes hide away unconscious bodies on rooftops to ensure that no spawned swarm of rats will get to it.  - Corpses and unconscious bodies, will despawn when a similar body is created. While this will prevent piles of bodies to build up beyond 4-5, you can never be quite sure whether an unconscious body has simply despawned, or been eaten alive by rats (effectively meaning that you killed him and have to start the level over).  There's also bugs, such as the cellar chain at the hound pits starting to curl up, the pointer to an invitation being diplsayed despite the related scene that spawns it never taking place, and two Tallboys on the same level mysteriously ending up as corpses floating in the water in the beginning of the level.     MAKE THE FEMINIST VOICES STOP!  As for the feminism, all lower class women in this world is downtrodden because they are women (as your 'objectified' companion is 'happy' to point out) and the game throws every possible feminist scenario (hookers, ♥♥♥♥, romance stalking, sexual slavery, how much worse the country is when ruled by a man instead of a woman, and not a single mention of Emily's father) at you. You can actually get an instant game over from 'sexually' harassing a woman. It actually makes slitting the thoats of these overly victimized women oddly satisfying, because when you are being assaulted by feminist propaganda, the real enemy of this game becomes women, and if you kill all of them, then maybe the propaganda will finally stop.    TOO EASY  Also, this game is pretty casual. You have to be going for all the achievements, to make it challenging: Play it in the highest difficulty, never get seen, never kill, never buy anything, never use any powers, and aim to take out everyone. I'm talking about sedating the guard in front of a dog, and then move up to the dog to do a stealth takedown on it before it figures out what's going on.    HALF-LIFE 2 SET IN 1850  The Blink ability has had a negative impact on the setting of this game. As the characters can jump and use Blink (and sometimes doublejump with the Agility ability), in order to make places out of reach, the level designers had to make everything really, really tall. You have five meter tall bookshelves, wagons and cars that looks horribly elongated, and barrels who my grandmother could topple by just leaning against it.  The scenery itself, is just Half-Life 2 combines ripped straight off. This is Half-Life 2: Episode 3, set in the 1850s.    EXCELLENT LEVEL DESIGN  What barely makes up for all of the games annoying things, is the level design. The levels are always designs to give you lots of options, allowing you to tackle everything in the way that you want to. Usually you can hide under tables OR you can dive down from the roof-tops OR you can lure guars away with throwing bottles, OR you can avoid them altogether OR you can take the long way around.  Game also allows all the key people to be taken out via non-lethal means. Getting this wrong, was the main flaw with Deus Ex: Human Revoltuion. ...and these means are also very clever.    UNIMPRESSIVE STEALTH  This game makes a good attempt at stealth mechanics, but they remain just that: Mechanics. There is still plenty that stealth games can improve in terms of realism: - If you cross a backlit area, your silhouette won't get spotted. - The guards won't see you crossing an empty street from far away. - Guards won't get blinded (or even cover their eyes) by having spotlights shone into their eyes. - Guards won't feel a draft at their neck as you open two huge double doors behind them. - Some guards will pee every five minutes. - People won't care if you run around at a party with your weapons out, trampling all the rose bushes. - Hiding in/behind bushes doesn't work. - Guards just stand around forever until you trigger their scripted conversation. - Placing unconscious guards on top of weepers won't count at you killing them through plague infection. - You saving a woman (because it has to be a woman - feminism doesn't allow men in these sort of situations) carrying an improved strain of the plague, will count as a good thing instead of making you responsible for hundreds of more deaths. All these things make Dishonored 'just a game', with AI units patrolling along routes. Although these routes are fairly unpredictable (which is good) this would have been okay back in the Thief days, but today should set better standards for realism, than that.    DLC (THE KNIFE OF DUNWALL &amp; THE BRIGMORE WITCHES)  One thing should be made clear: The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches, are two halves of one game. Just buying one of them will only give you half a story. The Knife of Dunwall will give you some buildup, that it abruptly cut short, and The Brigmore Witches will continue from that point. When buying, make sure that both of these DLCs add up to a reasonable price for ONE normal length game. Sometimes you can get the GOTY edition of Dishonored for a cheaper price than these DLCs combined, and this edition will seamlessly integrate into Dishonored if you already have it.  This DLC does not feature Corvo as the main protagonist, but will to some degree tie into the original story. It features some changes and improvements of abilities, and the level design is richer too. However, the overarching main plot is slow-moving and almost non-existant, and you (and the character) is severely lacking in motivation.  The feminist undertones we saw in the original game, is now much more tolerable, only manifesting themselves in typical 'strong and capable woman' NPCs. ...not that I'd call any of them good role-models by any means.  I give the DLC the same score as Dishonored: 3 out of 5.",1,0

65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"After near 300 turns and hours of play, I must say this is a very nice twist on the 'Civ V hexbased franchise' (for lack of a better descriptor). It's not Alpha Centauri, but definitely just as fun. Plays very differently though, with the tech web being one of the major changes. The quest system is a great way to guide growth toward one of the victory conditions, and the culture/affinity system is of an interesting design but takes some getting used to. Small grievances towards feedback on some of the tooltips, e.g. not all effect of quest choices are explained in the tooltip when you have to choose.   All in all a cool experience, which I heartily recommend to any Civ fan. Definite 9/10.   I am very curious to any DLC this game may get in the future (if any).",1,0

286570,F1 2015,"i do not understand why everyone hates this game so much. For sure there are some bugs and the online part is very laggy but apart from that it is really good. The AI is the best i have ever seen in a racing game they divebomb you but they are still fair. The Handlingmodell is really good aswell in my opinion it is on par with the iRacing one in generall of course iRacing is a little bit more unforgiving but in terms of the actuall limit of the car f1 2015 is more realistic because I was faster in the iRacing Mclaren than i was in the f1 2015 one. I think if Codemasters improve the right things f1 2016 even gets close to the almighty rFactor2 which is probably the closest a game can get to real life prooven by the Formula 1 Teams who use the pro version of Rfactor2 for their simulators. In my opinion f1 2015 already beats iRacing and the very iRacing-ish Assetto Corsa although iRacing is used by a lot of professional drivers due to their huge community. F1 2015 is better because of some little things such as the unstability under breaking or the handling in the corners. As a guy who has driven a Formula Renault 2.0 car once i have to say the f1 2015 one is more challenging than the iRacing one. But again i have to say nothing gets even close to Rfactor2. My Ranking of the sims I have ever played ( in terms of realism and singleplayer) 1. Rfactor2- very realistic Handling, good and challenging AI, great price 2. F1 2015- quite realistic handling, very good and very challenging AI(the best out there),very good graphics( 2nd best to project cars) 3. Assetto Corsa- good handling but a bit to slippery and simple sometimes, at least some AI 4. iRacing-good but too slippery and simple handling, no AI but good community 5. Project Cars- too simple and grippy Handling, bad AI, bad community but good graphics- the letdown of the last 5 years",1,0

275610,,"One of those reviews where you are on the fence about recommending the game, gameplay itself is great it very diablo 3 like in its combat, if your a fan of the 40k universe you will love the weapon animations, its perk system is very simple but you unlock everything very fast, from health bonuses to weapon bonuses and extra grenade slots and the levels can be challenging at times. Survival mode is awesome, i will keep playing it for a long time to come.  There are quite a few downsides to the game, camera angles being the biggest for me, sometimes it outright makes the game unplayable, have screenshots to show how horrible they can be at times, the start up also has this weird green streaking which obviously will never be fixed and gives a poor introduction to the game, screenshots also provided, it feels kind of unfinished but i would say more unpolished, its the little details that where missed.   After 10 hours of gameplay im getting sick of the poor camera, lost oppotunity because there is a small selection of chapters to select from, would have been worthy dlc to add extra chapters or even chaos for the chaos fans out there. The game is really short and you should complete it within a few hours, dont pay full price for it, i would recommend it only on sale otherwise stay away until its on sale or they come back to this project and fix the random crashes, green screen and worse camera angles ive ever experienced in a game.",-1,0

You can't commit to finishing a campaign because at any moment you will get repeatedly booted back to the steam library leaving you with the immediate choice of should I bother trying to play it again or just try to find something else that is similar. Issues include: freezing during saving (really annoying after you just won an epic battle only to loose it all), insta close after the 4th round of fall of the samurai, you won't see the end of your first winter so unless you can conquor Japan in 3 turns, you won't complete the campaign.

225020,Tomb Raider (VI): The Angel of Darkness,"I have a weird relationship with AoD. It is by far the worst Tomb Raider game mechanically, it's full of bugs, the gameplay shows its age badly, and it's almost hostile to the player in how unfinished it seems. Yet, I keep finding myself drawn to it. Is it the overblown, almost Dan Brown-esque conspiracy storyline? Is it the almost exclusively modern European setting? Is it the fact that their are glimmers of amazing ideas in there (such as the RPG-esque levelling up system)? Well, yes, yes, and yes. If you read around AoD's production, not only do you get insight into CORE's struggles and the troubled development cycle, you also see hints of genuine passion and great ideas. And in the end, that is what I like about AoD, the unattainable. I wish I could experience their 'Lara in Arabia' concept, or see how Lara survived the end of TR4, I want to see the sequel set in the catacombs of Capadoceia, I want more Kurtis. But all I'm left with is this awful, broken game. And I love it for it.",1,0
208480,Assassin's Creed® III,"Alas, I beat the 3rd game after 51 hours of gameplay. This is one of my favirote, although it is the most different, Assassin's Creed game in the series. I believe that just exploring and side missions gives this game a huge thumbs up for me, but what really takes the cake is the story. The plot is set with a different character and far from the old Altair and Ezio Auditore sequences of its original line-up crew. The story may be great, but maybe I really also enjoyed it because of the times we are fighting in (1750s-1780s American Revolution) and playing the unique Connor native american. Some complaints with the graphics would be the FPS drops in Boston and NY, but other than that I really have no complaints about it. Got it on the christmas sale for $7.50 and I defintely would recommend it for such a low price!  The game is great, but I feel the best is still yet to come!",1,0
241600,Rogue Legacy,"The gameplay never gets repetitive, you get random children with different abilities and the levels are always random.

And the game that incorporates all of these things into one awesome package is Batman: Arkham Asylum [GOTY]. I just love how Rocksteady portrayed Batman as the one true dark hero he was supposed to be. And yes, I said 'supposed' because no other Batman game every gave him the dark essence that surrounds him as seen in various comic books. Also, the Game of the Year Edition (GOTY) comes with all the DLC this game has to offer, and all for just $19.99.  So to end my recommendation, here is a riddle....

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Not at all like the previous games in the series. It has 'Terrorist Hunt', but your map is chosen for you by game, and your outfittng (gun/armor choices) are limited to certain characters. You can't even customize the character. That was a reason I liked the last two games, Vegas 1 &amp; 2. Not a fan of multiplayer games, so I should have just ignored this one.  The destructible walls/floors/cielings are cool, but you can only shoot through some of it. A nice feature, but it doesn't make up for about 30% of the game they removed. The menus are very confusing to navigate, and it just feels like a ripoff going through the gun customizations and seeing all the 'in-game currency' requirements and purchaseable exp boosters. They're playing the microtransaction game too hard in an already starved for content game.  Don't buy.  Edit: Feb, 11 2016  I've come across a method for filtering out what map you want to play for Terrorist Hunt. It involves going to Options &gt; Matchmaking Preferences and then setting 'on' or 'off' for the maps you want or don't want the server to choose from. Extremely contrived and I hope they change it, but there you go. Map Selection.  Playing around with the different characters and guns still makes me yearn for the full armory available for each character, but Ubisoft is still clinging to 'PVP balancing'. As a purely PVE player, I could care less.  After getting used to the quirks, I'd raise my grade for the game up from a D to a C-, but I still don't reccommend it.  THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO LIKED R6 VEGAS 1 + 2 SO F OFF DISSENTERS",-1,0

I don't like how cartoon-y it is, but the gameplay changes have grown on me. Initially, I was disappointed, as I wanted a new version to Civ V, but now that I have spent more time with it, I can see that most of the changes were a good thing. Almost every part of the game has been revamped. Land utilization is paramount as districts provide valuable bonuses, but farms and mines are necessary for growth, and wonders essential for cultural and diplomatic growth. The AI is still dumb, unfortunately. In this installment it shows in surprise war declarations that bring no actual assaults, denouncements for silly things, and them asking for free stuff constantly. Overall the replay value is as high as it's ever been with Civ, just take your time with it early on.",1,0

214770,Guacamelee! Gold Edition,"There's a lot more to wish from indy hit  Guacamelee  but one thing the game does right, one thing from which all other game companies should learn, one thing so important that it got me to start writing video game reviews on a hopefully weekly basis, and that's GAME DIFFICULTY.  Game Difficulty is not an excuse to make players redo the whole stage over and over again because you missed a jump. 'Difficult' is not adding HP or extra damage to monsters. I swear there are still too many punishing mechanics masked as challenge curves such as forcing the player to wait or rushing to reclaim everything that you've earned in a previous playthrough. 'Difficult' makes the player think and plan. 'Difficult' should challenge the game developer as much as it challenges the player.   Guacamelee  is difficult, especially if you want the true ending, but it's not punishing. I miss a jump, I go back to the last platform, I try again. THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE. THIS IS WHAT EARNS THIS GAME THE THUMBS UP FROM THIS REVIEWER. I never felt like I was wasting any time playing Guacamelee. There's variety in the platforming challenges, introduced by incorporating the special moves that you discover as tools to broaden movement. The Rooster Uppercut introduces double, then triple jumps. The Dashing Derpderp (bad name, I know), brings a horizontal dash and so forth... There's no resource management to worry about (and that's including health management), you just have the platform challenge in its purest form.  I'm old. Thirty-five years old. I've played the old NES platformers.  There is absolutely nothing good to remember from any of these games.  None. I'm gushing because I remember ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Castlevania, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ninja Turtles and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Megaman and  Guacamalee  ISN'T LIKE THAT. Thank goodness. By the way, that's why every review of Shovel Knight has made me wary of it. Briefly considered it, considered the hype, remembered the old days and went NUH-UH.  Ironically, the hard mode of this game is a complete wash. Just more damage from the monsters and more hits required to kill 'em. Kinda breaks the whole point of my review but I really wanted to laud everything else about this game.  It really does seem like a fun challenging platformer with monsters thrown in because of course you need monsters to smash. A whole combo tutorial camp and none of its lessons are ever necessary. A game built around luchadors and then you have this weak ♥♥♥ combat system. It's kind of a bait-and-switch in that regard: the moves you unlock seem to have a platforming purpose first and an enemy bashing purpose second... Artificial purpose at that, what with the introduction of colored shields to force you to use the appropriately colored attack. That's a juvenile way to handle combat. Boss fights centered on pattern recognition? Yes, that is a hallmark from the platformers of old but that doesn't mean you couldn't add some innovation on it.  I ain't mad, and this is coming from a huge wrestling fan who bought the game because he wanted to play a luchador protagonist. The rest of the game made it worth it.",1,0
319050,Chaos Reborn,"I have only been playing the game a short time, but I can tell already it's going to be a keeper because it's just so addictive!

214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,"Well where to start, I have been a fan op the entire TW franchise since Shogun 1 came out! so Rome 2 needed to be in my posession as fast as possible. It's true you'll find a lot of negative reviews on here because Creative assembly has the nasty habit of releasing the games full of bugs, but they also have the great habit of eliminating those bugs bit by bit and ending up with awesome, wellbalanced games.  The standard title takes you back to the early days of the roman empire and gives you the choice of managing certain factions; Rome being one of them ofc. You are basically the emperor in charge of everything from foodsupply, religion, taxing, esionage and military command.  Theres two major parts in the game; The campaignmap lets you see 'the big picture' manage your cities, move your armies, spies and other subterfuge around. When two enemy armies meet or you are sieging a city or fortyou go to the second part op the game, the battlemap. On the battlemap you commat the armies you created, make the cavalry charge but watch out for spears! make the swordsmen hit the flank! its all up to you! you control every little aspect of the battle! So if you have always felt the general in you stir or a dictator is slumbering deep within you, maybe a fledgeling politician wants to make his voice heard? This is your game! Give it a go an have lots o fun!  The game also has a large community of mod makers and streamers, you only need to check out the steam workshop or  http://www.twitch.tv/jothin  and youll get lots of info, likeminded people and fans of the game. In short: This game is a must buy, must have!  ",1,0

417860,Emily is Away,"Basically, if you want to simulate your teen years trying to suck up to a &lt;female dog&gt; that puts you on an emotional rollercoaster, then play this game. I understand it could be considered a reflection of a real life story, but this is a story with no real...resolution. Is the resolution is to somehow stop yourself from being conned into these waste-of-time relationships? But you would never know it hurt until you got into one yourself and had some great experiences. So should you avoid all relationships altogether to completely eliminate that chance? Not quite...  ...I think it more or less shatters the expectation that the one you think will be with you forever is meant to be with you. There is no ONE person, and statistically there are probably several different viable candidates (even based on your picky 'ol criteria!). I mean look at the side character Emma or whoever it is you end up hanging out with at college. What the &lt;H-E -Double Hockey Sticks&gt; was wrong with her? Did she die? Seems like you had buttloads of fun with her!  Maybe when I have gone through the thick of these teen/young adult years I will come out with a better resolution, but perhaps this is what the author meant:   It is best that you go away sometimes  , that you set the pace for your life and that emotional attachments, like most other things, can be transient in this world. But don't let this get you down, it may be worth it to love after all, and we are social creatures. I wish you the best of luck with this.  4.5/5 Heart Containers",1,1

450220,Overload Playable Teaser,"Descent didn't really hit my thoughts at the beginning when I played this game, until I've read other reviews about this game then it started to click. Also from reading the description of the game too, they stated that it was from the creators of Descent (I should start reading that). Besides that anyway, the game looks really good especially if you're someone who missed the old Descent days and just want to dive into that sea of nostalgia. Sadly this was probably a time that I was still way too young to know about video games like this so I'll just leave the rest for veteran players to review that part. As a new player, it was a pretty simple and fun game but I wish they added something with a more modern content into it. It's still a alpha/beta build anyways so they might add a little bit more here and there.  Don't let it sway you from playing this game though, this game is pretty fun at it's current state if you want to pass the time and cry a little inside whenever you get shot down by the robot that's been strafing left and right which you can't seem to hit for some reason #me  But anyways, for anyone who would like to check our gameplay of it out, we invite you to this link:   https://youtu.be/6B0le-E0uXU ",1,0

291010,The Hat Man: Shadow Ward,"At first the game lures you in with a scary atmosphere, and gives you a simple goal to find some pages, and a random ghost for some reason. And for a while, the only thing to scare you is your imagination as you go through a literal endless 1st level that's extremely hard to find anything in, but after a while you learn that this game isn't going to abuse you, it's going to take things slow, maybe a little too slow for a horror game, but then on the second level, it starts getting a little scarier with better ambience, Hatman gets faster and goes through walls for some great jumpscares, as well as an even creepier atmosphere and a little more progress through the story, though not much. Even so, it's a pretty well made game and I'm so excited that the official release finally came. However, there are still some issues that I don't quite like.. Not too big but issues: TOO BIG! Holy crap finding your way through this place and collecting items is harder than a dark souls boss, and progression through 1 level can take maybe an hour if you're not familiar with the game, and seeing the same thing over and over again isn't fun. The second issue is that Hatman only gets harder through levels and not time. I should know, because I'm one of the people who spent an hour on the first level. As you're looking through the first floor frantically looking for missing pages, or an item you may have missed, you get lost easily and well.. It stops being fun. Mostly because Hatman is like a companion you can kill but respawns.. Kind of like Tails in the sonic franchise, he never dies and he will come back later but.. You can kill him again easily. The problem with this is like a battle in skyrim against a townie who can't die, you can hit him over and over and over and over again but he won't go down for good, and the battle is infinite because you can't die to him either. The only option is to step outside and face the guards waiting for you,,,, though in this game that's more like the only option is to keep searching for items.. But other than ALL of that, great game!",1,0

230410,Warframe,"I LOVE Warframe, i've spent hours on it, but I to be honest it has some pretty bad issues (that eventually) led to me slowly stop playing the game. For starters, i'm probably not the only one, but connectivity and playing with friends takes FOREVER, like the loading screen for a mission. You can stay there for 30+ min (I have experienced this many times). Also, the lag in the game. I know Warframe is beautiful in graphics but even with a nice computer and all the settings on low, I still freeze, and see flying kubrows, enemies, etc.Sadly that is not the only problem. The fact that after awhile, shooting the same enemies and listening to the same dialouge is a bit disappointing and dull after doing basically everything. I enjoy the fact that they keep updating the game, but how about new enemies? A new race of enemies? Games like LoL, Dota2, Terraria, Minecraft (In my opinion) have the replayability that many games I look for don't have. How? Even though each game is 'the same' its not. For instace LoL, Dota2, you will never fight the same enemies and each game will be different, and with new content, its always interesting. Minecraft and Terraria, a lot of playability, building infinite amount of creations, lots of content, etc. Now Warframe however, sure has nice playability in the start. The missions at first are cool and exciting. But when you go to those same maps over and over, shooting the same people over and over for the same type of missions. Yeah, not very exciting anymore. So when I see new missions (like Mirage's missions) I go crazy. If only there were more variety, more variables in the game. Mobas have many combinations of team comps. And each game has other players, so different playstyles and skill levels, so the game will never be the same even though it is.Now I do compare Warframe to other games, but how can you talk about a game you once play that you don't? And the other games offer the things I, and other players want that Warframe either doesn't offer at the moment, or perhaps doesn't do the best at.",1,0

Then when it came out it started getting good reviews and good internet buzz and I thought, 'Well, a lot of bad games get good reviews and have people defending it online. It's probably just unfounded hype.'  Then the free weekend for PC rolled along and I was like 'Alright fine, I'll try the game!' So I hustled myself a code online and by the end of the weekend I had had so much fun playing I couldn't wait a couple of days for it to drop in price during the Steam sale. I had to have it at once so I could keep playing.   Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a joyfully addictive FPS with strategic gameplay and a highly skill-based difficulty curve will definitively make it my go to FPS in 2016.",1,0

The story is engaging as it ever was and the characters are colorful, well developed and nicely voiced, with some surprising appearances along the way. The puzzles are well balanced and satisfying to solve without being too difficult or really obvious. If you get stuck in any puzzle the hint system is really helpful and well designed, gradually revealing the answers to the puzzles so you can figure it out for yourself and won't need a walkthrough if you get stuck in the game. All in all a great adventure game and a must have for adventure fans. Can't wait for the second part.",1,0

367580,Hook,"WIth a price like this, especially on sale, you're either a complete Scrooge or your wallet is totally dead from all the other things to pass up a little gem like this. Frankly, I don't know why there are negative reviews at all, considering how cheap this is. Are you really gonna find a game better than this for the amount you're paying? Hook is surprisingly complex for a minimalistic game, and while no level is impossible, it takes a few tries and you'll always hear that satisfying 'click' as the last lock unravels at the end of a level. Difficulty wise, again the curve is fairly maneagable as the game slowly introduces more complex mechanics over the 50 levels, and the introduction of the 'three strikes/lives' is a nice help later in the game where it gets to the point where it's almost impossible not to make a mistake. Length wise, it took me about 45 minutes to finish, no walkthrough required, but I was getting into a rhythm and just steam-rolling through at times. It really depends on your approach to solving these puzzles. Some find it fun to do it completely in their heads, others might trace the wires around. The ambience is really nice and I found myself getting into the zone, where despite the sheer amount of different 'locks', it was still possible to figure out which line lead to where without too much effort, and the super minimalist design does Hook justice here.   Hey, you can spare some change right? Get this.",1,1

When this appeared during the holiday sale, I decided I ought to have it on a current device and snatched it up. The game and story are still every bit as engrossing as I remember them, but I find the lack of controller support to be super-annoying. Furthermore, perhaps it is just my laptop, but graphical issues abound. I can't Alt-Tab without the program crashing (which means that any time I adjust the volume it crashes); it also crashes frequently during cutscenes. I am sure I could rectify some of these issues with some internet research and some editing of the .ini file, but I don't think I should HAVE to do that.

It is very fun and keeps me occupied for hours. If I choose, I can host my own dedicated server and have friends join in on the fun. Single player characters can be used in Multiplayer games as well.

33230,Assassin's Creed II,"I currently haven't played the PC version of the game but I am trying my best to play it now. The only problems are that it takes forever to install (but yet again that goes for ALL big games, so I guess you shouldn't take that to heart), and after that I put my earphones in and thought 'Hey I can play this game finally!' only to have that lovely prospect put under my nose before being thrown to David Cameron's prize piggy, Skyrim was a large game but it didn't require all the different installs and patches this thing needed. If you've finished the first installation be aware you have another hour left. If you were prepared for this it wouldn't be that much of a biggy but I was given no prior warning to this and so it's like going into a cinema and having the opening for the movie played every now and then but then it cuts to a massive string of adverts. When I finally got to the Uplay section and made an account I thought I got to play. Not very likely! The game simply froze and told me it had stopped working. I then tried to start the game up again but the same thing happened. And again. This process happened numerous times.  Now I have yet to actually play the game, but while playing it on PS3 I would say it is a very good game, lots of funny stuff in it and it's all very nice when you get to stab someone. But be aware getting INTO the game may take a longer time than it would take to actually get through the whole thing. I would give this game a thumbs up for the content but to be fair I'd actually like to play the damn thing.",-1,0

99810,Bulletstorm,"Forget the laws of physics.  ok, initially I was reserved about this game, but tall my doubts have been dispelled.   Before I start, I'd like to say 'yes', it is possible to disable those annoying points popping up whenever you kill someone in an ingenious ways. Perhaps, there are a few who care about that, but I was constantly afraid that those points would mar the gameplay for me and ruin the immersion - which is sorta what happened with Borderlands. There is no way to disable the crosshair though.  Anyways, you play as vigilante turned space pirate. Well, it's a bit more complicated than that but they explain the reasons in the first 15 minutes of the game. Your character kinda looks like a raptor only with hair but at the same time he has a voice and personality, which is always welcome in shooters. Still, you have no body and cast no shadow so still you are, for the most part, just a couple of arms floating around. Maybe I should spend the next 5 years of my life studying programing and video game designing so I could get a job with some gaming company and be in charge of creating legs and shadow for the character you play in a shooter. You do get to see your legs when you slide though; So annoying...  The game is using Unreal Engine 3 which is considered outdated by many, even though it does the dynamic lightening thing, it's seems a bit too stale, the fire looks really outdated, the textures look like they are stacked on top of each other, plus I'd say that the physics need a little work. They used the same engine for Gears of War 2 as well the Singularity game, which wasn't for my liking to say the least. Even the electric leash you use in the game is sorta reminiscent of the hacking tool in Bionic Commando as well as the device you were wearing in Singularity. What's annoying though is that even if you disable auto-aim and aim assist, the leash would still auto-aim for you and pull your screen in the direction of the object being pulled. Both Singularity and Bulletstorm implement the slow mo sniper bullet time wherein you can actually guide your bullet towards the enemy.  Also, what I found unsettling is that you can use your leash infinitely. You can actually beat a large chunk of the game (minus the bosses) by using your leash and kicking enemies until they are dead.  You can also dash and slide for a long time. Like, REALLY long time. You don't get to slide on the floor as far as you can in Vanquish, however you are still able to slide for an unnaturally long time on rough surfaces and shoot at enemies, somehow. You actually move faster in the game by sliding all the time instead of running, which makes little sense. But that makes it harder for enemies to hit you and for you too hit them since you are sliding too fast; and there is no stamina bar. Hell, you can even slide uphill if that fits your fancy.  The kick. Well, yeah, the kicking ability really does augment the gameplay. But I wouldn't want people to consider this kicking ability to be something special and innovative, since I would like that credit to go to The Dark Messiah game which I am pretty sure was the first one to implement the kicking ability which always came in handy in kicking enemies off the cliffs and even in melee fights.   In the trailer you can see the enemy growling in agonizing pain after you shot him in his groin equipment. However, on hard mode, after growling for a few seconds, your enemy will recover, deal with the loss of the important male body part and then keep on shooting at you.  Blood. Yes, there is plenty of blood leaking and bursting out of your enemies. And there's plenty of gore and decapitations in general. You will get to see some loose limbs lying around. It did get under my skin to see those giant plants eating the savages though.  Cursing, yes, there's plenty of that too.  There are no free weapons in the game. You earn new weapons by getting skill shots. You also get to upgrade them so there is incentive to kill enemies in different ways - just as advertised.  The enemies look nice. They look a bit too buff and too clean though for a wasted planet.  One major flaw of the game is that if you outrun your enemies, that is if you outslide them and choose to slide past towards your objective and venture too far then you will die. Supposedly, you get shot in the back which is what one of the loading screen tells you. So I guess that is how they fixed the problem of rushing in this game, well maybe they should made the game slightly more challenging and took away the infinite sliding ability.   The sidekick in the game is also quite interesting and intriguing. While the character you play is a hairy and smelly loud mouthed ego-maniacal raptor, your juxtaposed sidekick is quite different. His cold calculated decisions and logical unbiased thinking reminded me of Spock, I think that was a nice touch. It is fun seeing the two battle out the the classic fate vs. coincidence moments.  I'm not going to say that the general gameplay of this game is flawless and that everyone will like it, but the pacing of the game is good and it will let you kill some time. The game reminded me of Borderlands on some occasions. You get see the giant skeletons of prehistorical creatures, just like in Borderlands.The AI is okay. The enemies rush, shoot, take cover, melee.  On the general positive note, the game has plenty of funny moments that are guaranteed to put a smirk on your face. Even when you can think of every possible classy quote, chances are, it's already been used and has become a cliche somewhat. However, this game does squeeze out quite a many memorable quotes that you probably didn't hear before. Some things are pretty innovative, especially the amusement park and some escape levels.There is never a dull moment and there are some memorable battle and escape sets and despite the strict linear gameplay, I still had fun feeling like an unstoppable killing machine in the world that makes little sense.  Regardless, I felt the need to pick the game to pieces and poke fun at its inconsistencies and complete disregard for the laws of physics, but I nevertheless had a good time playing it, and I still do. It's highly probably you will beat the game twice.  P.S. The last two words in the game made my day.",1,0

405640,Pony Island,"I normally don't write reviews, but this game practically begged for it.  I think I saw 'Pony Island' on the front page when I first logged on. It looked pretty interesting, so I threw down my $4.99 and loaded it up; a few minutes in, I was hooked.  I'm very bad at writing actual words so I'm going to resort to a pros/cons list.  Pros:   A very cool concept, presented well.   Contains very cool commentary regarding player/developer relations.   Lots to explore and discover. I definitely didn't see everything my first playthrough.   Puzzles and challenges simple enough to avoid frustration, yet difficult enough to feel rewarding.   Music is alright, not the best but still good.   Probably one of the coolest bosses I've seen in a while.   Cons:   Very short. Not necessarily a con, but worth mentioning.   Jumping portions were tedious.   Graphics were neat, but gave me a headache.   Some bosses were very boring.   All in all, a very cool game that is absolutely worth 5 bucks. Give it a shot!",1,0

245280,ENSLAVED™: Odyssey to the West™ Premium Edition,"Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is the 2010 action-adventure game developed by Ninja Theory (noted for Heavenly Sword and infamous for DmC: Devil May Cry) and published by Namco Bandai, recently re-released for the PC with all the DLC included.   Important to note: use a gamepad. Most are compatible with PC and easy to set up, it's a worthwhile investment, especially for games like these.  The majority of the time spent ingame is on a functional if barebones hack n slash combat system and 'Uncharted-like' platforming system.   Combat itself is very responsive - the counter will always work, the evade has a nice amount of i-frames, and you never feel like you're working against the game, just with it. It is, predictably, marred heavily by its sheer lack of variation - you will be working with the same moves from beginning to end, bar a few bought 'enhancements' that won't affect your actual combos, and enemy variation caps out at 4 with three minibosses.   Combined with the platforming that's completely braindead and nigh automated, and while the game never gets boring it's never in danger of challenging you or demanding anything resembling skill, even starting on Hard. The upgrade system ingame exacerbates this, simply making an already easy affair easier.  Despite the odd novelty shooting segment or 'Cloud' platforming section, where you impersonate Tony Hawk in a post-apocalyptic setting (the most fun sections of the game), and the aforementioned minibosses, the game never has any 'real' boss battles or sense of climactic moments. The game eventually blends into a continuous slurry, pacing-wise.  A gorgeous slurry at that. Every single environment in Enslaved is eye-candy, with even the more robotic-leaning levels managing to impress and becoming absolutely stunning during the Village levels. Animations are fluid and the camera supports it, with the game taking advantage of its limits. While the story goes from interesting to dull to absolutely stupid, the voice-acting throughout all of it is top-notch.  Worth mentioning is that the included DLC, 'Pigsy's Perfect 10', is more than just weirdly good: it's almost as fun as the base game, a 3-hour or so romp playing as 'Pigsy' with four gadgets, an unlimited amount of bullets, and more stealth-oriented gameplay. You can access it in 'Extras', which is a bit out-of-the-way.  Unfortunately the OST - outside of the DLC's banjo-infested romps which never fail to get old - is boring orchestrated filler and completely forgettable, with a lot of seeming SFX issues on top of it; actions triggering with no sound attached. The game as a whole is almost hilariously glitchy - nothing game-breaking, but I've had to restart at Checkpoints several times with Trip falling through the game world or Monkey doing the monkey dance midair. Forever.  Enslaved, at its best, plays like the likes of 'Jak and Daxter' with fast-paced combat and platforming, and at its worst, plays like a dry, dull AAA affair with railroaded platforming, forced cover-based shooting segments and blatant technological problems. Ultimately, it's worth playing and then some, but not without keeping the caveats in mind.  It's not a game you should be buying for the mechanics, but to look at idly while you skim through it once then forget about it. It doesn't have the depth or the variety to support multiple playthroughs and ultimately ends up a bit of a chore (take it from me). Absolutely no incentive to 100% it either, not so much as a congratulations message. Still a bit sore about that.  Keep it in mind when you see it in a sale, is what Enslaved: Odyssey to the West deserves. It deserves something.",1,0

394230,Battleborn,"I can't give this game enough praise. It is everything I was hoping for and more. This game has kept me laughing the entire time but what do I really like about the game?.....  The strategy aspect. This is not your typical shootem up Call of Duty clone. This game takes real strategy without just rushing into the enemy team looking for kills. I've been on teams that had twice the number of kills as the enemy team yet we still lost because they worked together to complete the objective.   Between the talent trees and gear, each character feels completely unique. The games are fast paced and full of action. In fact there is so much going on that it is overwhelming for the first few hours of play. I just didn't understand this by watching Twitch channels and Youtube videos. This game has depth and requires investment if you want to have success.  The only downside is the lack of players PC side. I've heard the console version is doing just fine but the que times for Meltdown can be quite lengthy. Unfortunately that is my favorite game mode. I'm still holding out though.

But if you want to see what could happen in such combination, please buy 'Bulb Boy', it will probably ruin your 'sweet dreams'. Don't get me wrong, it isn't 'scary' game, it's just sick fairy tale about Bulb Boy, who is fighting his own anxiety and nightmares.   When you was small, you probably saw something innocuous, but during dreams the same 'innocent' thing appeared in twisted, horrifying way. This is what 'Bulb Boy' is about - fighting child's inner fears about every-day reality and about happiness and cohesion of a family.   Anyways, 'Bulb Boy' is a rich source of messages for every headshrinker:-D  Be aware, this game isn't standard point'n'click adventure. Certainly, there is objects combing and normal inventory, but the tasks are very simple and there's a lot of arcade elements. It's just casual game, where you want to see some abominable, nasty, gross, but funny things, but not really tricky puzzles, or riddles.   Check this game out, if you want to see some disturbing, but good graphics, working mechanis, and black, twisted humor. Avoid it when you're looking for a top notch, classic adventure game in Gabriel Nigt, or Monkey Island style.  Nevertheless, Tim Burton should be proud:-)   PS.

391730,Crashlands,"Just manage to finish this game. I think it is more suitable to people who have too many time in their hands. There isn't a leveling system. It feels like a single player mmorpg whereby you need to hit damn a lot of monster and same monster just to farm to the next level of workshop. It is easy to craft certain item but it is also very hard to find those rare material for faming. Do not be despair whereby certain item is totally optional. I never get a single hair louse at all even though I finish the game. Also, try not to overfarm certain item, just get enough of it should be fine. There is more than 300 items in the game. Fastest way to win this game is to...   1) Learn not to get hit at all. They practically 1 hit KO you if you don't have full set of armor, but the dodging is easy once you have 100% damage range weapon or more stun. Try get those eventually. There is a lot of different type. 2) Aim for the next workshop/upgrade. 3) All armor is optional once you learn (1). Just focus on weapon. I skipped a lot of armor building since it is a hassle to find those ingredient. 4) MIssion is important, even it looks optional because certain recipe only can get from the quest. There are two quest I remember mission stucked is the Nitro(1st map) and the Thrombopump(3rd map) because I thought those are optional quest.

219890,Antichamber,"'Mind-bending' is less a description of Antichamber and more a hint for solving its puzzles. The game clearly has its own consistent internal logic and random things don't just occur to mess with the player's head. However, many of Antichamber's puzzles depend on upsetting the usual order of things to - if the tablets of advice hidden around the game are to be believed - teach a lesson about life. It is not terribly uncommon, for example, to turn around and find yourself in a different place than where you came from. It makes no logical sense, but over time, it becomes a reasonable solution. While still sporting more straightforward puzzles like covering a series of sensors with a limited number of blocks, Antichamber seems to more often beg the player to look at the problem sideways. Instead of looking for tools to get around obstacles, understand that every situation may not operate under the same set of rules. Be willing to adjust assumptions based on new observations. But these observations need to be made independently by the player as the game itself provides no real external assistance; even the ultimate purpose of the game isn't handed to the player. Without guidance, you're left to discover your own meaning to the strange and sometimes inconsistent world around you - just as everyone must do as they progress through life.",1,1

447530,VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,"This is a bit of a strange one. It's more or less a visual novel with mini games, but its suprisingly well written and engrossing. Has a bit of an emotional hit, but is also consistently hillarious.  The main mechanic of the game is mixing drinks (this is pretty simple, drag and drop). Characters behave differently based on what drinks you give them. The game basically always gives you something to do to break up the reading, even in the one or two scenes away from the bar.  I only got one ending (the 'good' ending) and I can't say I'm particularly compelled to play the game again to get more (it took about 10 hours to complete from start to finish and I'm a fast reader). The bartending mechanic probably helps, but maybe give a miss if you can't stand visual novels. But otherwise, I would definitely recommend a go through.  Some good points:  - Relatively well written - Consistently pretty funny - Suprisingly unique art style - Creative setting and environment - Engaging and engrossing - Pretty good soundtrack  Some bad points:  - Maybe a few too many Reddit memes - Story and setting is so open ended it's difficult for it to reach a satisfying conclusion. - Game is bad at providing feedback when one of your decisions has changed the story (this is important in making you feel like an active participant in the story, imo)",1,0

211500,RaceRoom Racing Experience ,"So here I am writing a review for RaceRoom Racing Experience. So my first impressions of the game are good, in terms of gameplay the sounds are immaculate and very realistic. The force feedback you recieve through the wheel are really good and racing is challenging especially in multiplayer.  Pros:  -Great Sounds -Great Force Feedback -Car models look good -Racing is a challenge and you feel like you are in a real car -Has support for all controllers (wheels and joysticks and controllers) -You can make your own overlay for a race and broadcast it live -If you drive the wrong way you ghost meaning that trolls cannot crash you out using a head on collision -Physics and handling are very realistic -Different modes: Novice, Amateur and Realistic -Decent Graphics and fps with support for high end and low end spec computers -Good default overlay -So many things that can be changed in settings  Cons:  -The free mode only comes with 3 (I think) car series and 2 (I think) tracks -No pit crew/garage interior -No Career mode where you can make your own racer and have any sort of car improvement -Mirror visibility is not great and hard to depict cars until they are too close to try and defend  I realise this game is still in development and i am looking forward to more content but I think sector3 studios have done a fantastic job on this game so its a thumbs up from me.  Therefore I would rate it 9/10 as there could be a few things that could be improved (like adding some more free dlc etc.) but it surprised me with how good the gameplay was.",1,0

217270,Karateka ,"Karateka is a pretty straightforward game, literally. You move one of three characters forward while fighting off guards and bosses. The fights are rhythm based and give you an indication of when to block and when to attack. It's a fun idea, unless you want to listen to some background music of course. You start off with the True Love. The idea is to finish the game with this character in order to get the true ending. If this character is defeated in battle, he'll be replaced by a new characters which also gives you a different ending. It's unlikely you'll finish your first game with the first character, because the battles increase in difficulty near the middle of the game, which is about 15 minutes in. That's right. The game only lasts 30 minutes per session.  The graphics are cartoony and look pretty good in motion. The movies, however, look, and probably are, compressed. The sounds are nothing to write home about, but they get the job done. Would I recommend it ? In a way, yes, because the character idea is fresh and it's fun while it lasts. But the current price is just to steep if you ask me, especially for a game this short (even though it requires multiple playthroughs). Wait for a pricedrop; then get it.  [Rating: 77/100]",1,0

From a perspective from someone who has held elected office, Tropico taught me a decent bit about the pitfalls of power and what to do/and what definitely not to do. Though it deals with the antiquated cold war ideals, I found that to be one of its strengths because it displayed just how horrible it probably was to be a member of the Third World and have the potentiality of a U.S. gunship landing on the shore.

I originally noticed Rocket League when I attended the convention RTX in Austin, Texas and watched Freddie Wong kick the butt of fellow players 2 on 1 as well as inviting members of the public to hop onto teams and join in. A game that anyone can just pick up and play is a wonderful idea and I haven't found a game like this in a long time.  Considering my internet connection is nothing but useless I also have to express my gratitude that the single player activites are very entertaining. Yes NPCs seem to get a kick out of scoring own goals or nudging the opposing players passes into your goal (even on the hardest difficulty) but the tournement style gameplay still made me want to score and win, or at least come away without the match ending in 0-N. Practice mode is also intresting, if annoying as trying to stay air born while being a car is a tricky thing to accomplish.  All in all, bar a few silly NPCs and my own internet issues, I would highly recomend getting this game.",1,0

219890,Antichamber,"As a species, humans have learned much about the many rules of Geometry. We make definitions, we draw pictures, we run experiments, we crunch numbers. Imagine if Geometry, by the same token, wished to learn about us humans, diverse and seemingly upredictable as we are. This game is that journey. Whereas we experimented with fragments of Geometry, like triangles, like circles, Geometry experiments of our species, like you, like me. When we conjectured rules about Geometry, we drew a picture, did some math, and tested it's consistency. When Geometry conjectures rules about humanity, it crafts a puzzle, does some math, and tests your consistency. Over time, using these experiments, we were able to prove many things about the Truths of Geometry, given some basic assumptions. Brainbending, and seemingly always to have some kind of overarching moral statement that is forever just beyond one's grasp, I am left wondering what it was that Geometry was proving about Humanity with this game, or what were it's basic assupions about us.",1,0

239350,Spelunky,"Spelunky is one of the best games I have ever played. It solves very well many of the troubles that are present in traditional platformers, while conserving the fast pace of gameplay and adding more interesting decisions. Because of its random generation, the game will never force you or even give you the option to replay levels that you have already played, meaning that it is a new and fresh experience each time, and it actually tests your ability to platform rather than how well you have memorized its levels. The controls are very tight, and the random generation is one of the most fair that I have ever seen; rarely will you get a level that is significantly more or less difficult than average. Also notable is that the average run length is very very low, maybe 1-5 minutes for a new player, since you will be dying a lot. A successful run (don't expect this at first) will take close to 20.  The game does have its flaws: personally I find the game significantly more difficult when playing with keyboard controls, and because the character jumps very low to the ground but runs very fast it plays significantly different from most platformers (you'll get used to this, don't worry). By far the biggest flaw is its difficulty curve. The first several runs where you make it to a new area will basically be 'oh, that kills you?' and you unexpectedly and hilariously die. At the end of the difficulty curve comes the endgame of score running and speed running and challenge running and things... I did these things because there were acheivements for them (like 200 hours into the game btw), and while I definitely enjoyed getting those acheivements, if you're actually trying to top (any of the) leaderboards or do some of the most difficult challenge runs (eggplant run) the game basically comes down to reseting for a good seed and taking every risk. But that's all strictly optional, and at least for me the option came after a few hundred hours of enjoyment.  Though I've thought a lot about the game's flaws, I love it. I spend a lot of time replaying the game and keeping my skills sharp, even if I'm focussing on some other game at the time. I strongly recommend this game.",1,0

105100,Lume,"I found this game disappointing. I bought it ages ago in a Groupees bundle and was intrigued by the unique but fine quality art style. I'm the type of person who puts off playing games, but I played this one right away.   It was very short and I didn't feel like the puzzles were very satisfying. There was one puzzle that I had to look up how to solve, (this seems to be a common issue) but the rest I solved before even getting their clues. I would find items that were completely useless for me. I kept expecting to leave the house after fixing it up, but the game just... ended.  Right now as it is I can't recommend it. I feel like it's definitely unfinished storywise and the difficulty is baffling to me. If it at least had steam trading cards I could say, 'play it if you get it in a bundle' but as it is, I can't even say that. I'd say just look at the pictures or watch the trailer because you'll get all the charm of the art, but none of the disappointment of the actual game.  Note: I am NOT one of the people who criticize this game for its length. I love Hamlet (also on steam) and it's only thirty minutes long. What bothers me is that it feels incomplete and the puzzles weren't fun to me.",-1,0

Grapical glitches occur regularly throughout gameplay causing objects such as doors to be textured incorrectly or flat out invisible. I tried to look into the options menu to see if there was any settings I could try chaning to fix this issue. Turns out there isn't an options menu, you can toggle fullscreen on and off, you can toggle music on and off, and you can see what the controls are, you can't even rebind the controls if you don't like the defaults. You can't change the resolution or anything that is expected of a modern day PC videogame. These issues and lack of features became very distracting and rendered the game unejoyable.

Honestly, my first red flag should've been when the game told me you could only gain a certain amount of experience/keys a day through solo play, but I guess developers have to keep the online alive somehow, even if it's not the best way to do so.  However, the real problems started showing when we started playing and realized the changes made that honestly felt like Turtle Rock knows nothing about proper balance, even with a game like this. Depending on who you're with or up against, it's either a win with no way for the monster to fight back, or the monster clears out the entire team before even getting half way to stage two. Not to mention there are certain hunters that feel like they were made without even thinking of how OP they could be (like Maggie being able to track the monster's every move, Val being able to revive fallen hunters from afar with her medi-ray, Hank being able to give every hunter so much armor the monster can't punch through it before he gives it right back, etc).

394450,,"As someone who played through and enjoyed the mobile iOS game all the way through the first two difficulty levels and mostly through the last, I'm disappointed by this port. It feels incomplete in some sense, and almost lazy.   For those not in the know, in the mobile version, kit/unit expansion was done through requisition purchases and in-app purchases (hereforth to be referred to as IAP), to buy cards packs. These packs allow for you to get 3 cards, one marine and 2 items (with the chance for rare/epic cards). This system made sense with IAP being a potential option for people who don't have the time to endlessly grind levels and get a chance at getting better marines or gear.   I agree with the exclusion of in-app purchases, let me say that right here. But without them, the way forward is unfortunately set to be a grindfest, with a pack at the end of every chapter. Let's be honest, systems like these - with randomized rewards in a boosterpack like purchase are designed to encourage people to spend real-world money over and over on cards/items they don't need for the chance of getting something they want. That's how it works with trading card games, that's how it works in mobile apps. This system does not make sense in a premium game with no IAP, and as such should have been replaced with something else more fitting.   Maybe non-randomised cards. Gain more requisition per level like gold, buy a marine for X requisition, buy gear for X requisition. Spend requisition on your existing gear to upgrade gear. Meanwhile get exp on missions, level up and advance your marine. And when your marine is capped, spend requisition to advance him to the next tier. That's an example off the top of my head, and most likely would have been tweakable for a much better system than the one currently in place. As it stands you get a small amount of req per level, can purchase tiny 3 card packs, and maybe trade in unused marines and items for small amounts of req, making obtaining better marines and gear a grindfest. Not of the pleasurable kind.   Furthermore, the 3 Enhanced Edition chapters are not complete, and do not progress past tier 2, while the other 3 go to tier 4. Also, the graphics aren't even visibly that much better and there is still no multiplayer.  TLDR: feels lazy, exp/buying marine system broken, incomplete bonus chapter rosters, still no multiplayer. If you really liked the mobile one and want to grind your way through the game on PC go for it i guess...",-1,1

236390,War Thunder,"The potential for the game is here. With the most aircraft available of any flying sim ever, and the devs 'trying' to make it as close to real life as possible, it's definitly worth checking out. There's also a tank mode, worth checking out for the novelty, but it will get bland fast due to this mode not being finished yet.  THE PROS: Loads of airplanes with each their own flight model to try out, there's planes for the USA, Germany, Soviet Russia, Britian, Japan, and in lesser extent Italians.  With 3 modes to choose from, being arcade, realistic battle, and sim mode, there's a gamemode for everyone.  New content being added by patches every so often  THE CONS: don't let this scare you away, at it's core it's a really great game, however, it hasn't quite reached it's full potential yet, here's why:  The grind sucks, like really really sucks, at higher tiers, when you think you've finally completed all aircraft, get prepared for an even longer grind for plane modules to make your aircraft even remotely capable.  Unbalance, again, at higher tiers you will have 1944 aircraft flying against post war aircraft and jets.  Dev team unresponsive/not listening to community. This is the main factor for me. Many people have ideas how to make the game better in their way, and of course, some of these ideas are crazy and not possible. But when an entire gaming community complains at once about certain aspects of the game, and nothing is really done, that's going to be a real negative.  All in all, it's still a great game, don't take the grind too seriously, because you will get frustrated, instead, just try and play for fun, and suddenly the game seems a lot better, yes, it has it's issues, but there's not much to be done. We can only hope our suggestion's/complaint's/bug reports will reach the dev's someday.",1,0

While you might initially be put off by the lower-end graphics, I want to tell you to ignore that and focus on the gameplay. Sound and presentation also fit very well with the storyline.  That said, wait for a sale. Even with the unlockables, this is NOT a $20+ game. There's MAYBE 2 hours of content - unless you just completely suck at every aspect of gaming, you're going to see everything this game has to offer in the first day.

469920,hackmud,"  Well, let's review it.  Hackmud is a great game in my opinion. It does have some flaws BUT it is as far as I know a One-Man-Project and to create such a game alone is probably quite hard. I do have some experience with Linux + Coding in general, so the start was a bit easier for as it may be for others. E.g. my buddy bought this game for both of us, i do have experience, he doesn't. It is way harder for him to learn or understand some things in this game but he tries to learn and improve himself.  That showed me that this game is not only for people who know some stuff and more, but also for someone who does not give up and tries to learn more and more. It may be way harder but you got to start somewhere.  It's like the Dark Souls of Coding. You have to be careful who you trust and which script you run. (But you can trust dtr, he is a really nice and supportive guy. He even made an email-Account just for this game and you can mail him. Can't really say much about the others but be careful that v doesn't fools you.)  I also read some reviews and 1 negative review was quite interesting. He/She said that you can only write 1 line in your small scratch'book'. Well He/She didn't know that you can write more lines. Just hit STRG+Return/CTRL+Retunr/CMD+Return while you're 'writing' inside of it and boom you have a new line.  I also don't know much about server issues. Since I got the game it runs fluently and i never got a unwanted dc.  But I do have a really big issue: It is veeeery hard to get some GC (Money) once you're out of the prologue. Almost every low-tier NPC is already hacked and henceworth you can't get money to init your system. That way you can't upload any public scripts and more. I put about 4-5 hours into the game just to find some existing NPCs just to get the message that they are already hacked.  All in all it is a solid game, even though it is very hard to get some money. I like it, i will play it for a while and if you're interested in such games and you're not scared to learn and put many hours into a game than this might be something for you. Just be cautious, don't get fooled, try to learn and be patient.",1,0

413420,Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair,"This game asks the player to have a basic understanding of hydrolysis and relative densities of gases and the resultant properties of that, but does feel the need to remind you what an octagon is.  Seriously though, it's a good game if you like mysteries and watching characters that you get really attached to die (wait, what?).   Pros:   Well-made and interesting cases to solve   new and improved trial minigames are better than the first game   Original and more unique characters than the first game's (though those who do make a return appearance are a nice touch)   Cons:   Some of the cases require outside-the-box thinking or incredible attention to detail that I just don't think is logical.   Some minigames, especially Hangman's Gambit, can become overwhelming   The themes of the game and its setting clash really badly   Someone was worried about a murder occurring, so they confiscated everyone's forks.  Personal Taste:   Some of the characters, notably Peko and Nagito, can have their voice lines drowned out by music.   Gifting system is complicated and a community guide is basically required to go anywhere with it   Some of the depicted deaths are fairly brutal   It really sucks sometimes when your favorite character turns out to be a cold-blooded killer   In short, buy the first game first for a taste of this style and if you find you like it come here and prepare yourself for ~25 hours of reasoning, logic, child murder (Again, someone made a game about this?), and some seriously weird twists. Well worth the price, if you can get through an hour or so of Usami.",1,0

620,Portal 2,"Portal 2: A serious review.   So if the opening line of this review caught your attention, it might be that you're like me. You wanted to read some reviews before buying this game and you quickly got fed up with most of the 'most helpful' reviews giving absolutely no real information about what the game is like. Instead, you get the feeling that anybody who's played this game has sustained permanent brain damage. To not go on any longer, here are 5 reasons why I think Portal 2 is one of the best games I've ever played.  1. Graphics: The game is beautiful! Portal (1) looked great and it was released in 2007. Portal 2 looks 10x better! The game doesn't use too many resources so an average gaming PC or laptop will run it at max settings without a problem.  2. Physics: One of the greatest elements of this game is the amazing physics. You will have great fun discovering how to use the portals and other tools supplied to navigate and solve the well thought out puzzles. The game requires you to use forward momentum, perfect timing and fast thinking (amongst many other things) to complete puzzles. There is never a dull moment.  3. Pacing: The developers has again achieved a perfect sweet spot between making the puzzles challenging but not impossible. The game starts out with a few simple puzzles that really help you understand the basics of the game and how you can best use the portals and other tools to your advantage. After that the game gradually ramps up the difficulty keeping the game challenging and fun. With some patience and perseverance you can play through this whole game without having to consult a single walkthrough.  4. Dark Humor: Portal 2 returns with more characters than Portal 1 and the scripts are again absolutely hilarious. The game treats you as what you are a test subject and the machines are as you would expect them to be, cold and calculating in carrying out their agenda. However, I have to admit that GLaDOS was funnier in Portal 1.  5. Story &amp; Uniqueness: This game continues the surprisingly compelling story of Portal 1. I didn't think a puzzle game would have any decent kind of story but boy, was I wrong! Portal 2 is in a class of its own as an fps puzzle game that offers many hours of fun, challenging puzzles and great, hilarious scripts. My only regret is taking so long to finally play it.  P.S: these 5 points apply to both Portal (1) and Portal 2. I highly recommend you play Portal (1) first because it helps you paint a more complete picture of the full story and there are plenty of references to Portal (1) in Portal 2, including some steps in solving puzzles.  Thanks for reading. Do yourself a favor and buy this game! ",1,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"A great shooter to play with friends. Although it has a free to play set up, and everything can be puchased with money making the game pay to win, you can still get almost all of the items and guns by just playing. Lots of zerg based tactics with squads and platoons. The best is getting with a group of people and just roaming around capturing areas. It takes quite a bit of learning the map to know how to play. But once you understand the systems, its pretty easy to find a huge battle to fight in. The graphics are amazing especially considering how much is going on at once on the screen. There is everything from class systems for on the ground units, to vechile and air combat. Since the game is f2p they will try to get you to spend some money on skins or gun upgrades but none of it is really needed. Its all about multiplayer though as no single player story is added. Also the character customization is very limited when creating your character. If you have played Guild Wars 2 World vs World, or Elder Scrolls online Server vs Server, expect much of the same but with guns. Its worth giving a try, and if you like it you can always spend some money to support the devs. Reccomend for any shooter fan wanting something on a greater scale.",1,0

113400,APB Reloaded,"Having been riding shotgun on this rocky slope since the engine first breathed life, I've bared witness to the rise and fall of many events both majestic and miniscule. From the very beginning, connecting across the ocean to the Real Time Worlds European server to participate in the closed beta program through one scheduled hour a week, I felt that there was something metaphysical at work. Something without form, without function, sleeping beneath the silver sheen of this seemingly genre changing cops and robbers MMO.   There was something there behind the flying bullets, the untapped expression of creativity driven forth from every player, the static walls of San Paro and it's fleeing citizens. Like a father watching his infant son strike his first fluke homerun well out of the confines of the park, I remember excitedly tossing and considering the possibilities of a game like APB. It was destined for many things, much of which can only be described as allegory in light of the failed future this game was given by fate.   The son that knocked the ball out of the park, he could have been in the Major Leagues. He could have been so much more. Instead, somewhere between that first fluke shot and college, he found drugs and greed and turned that bat into a tool of violence for the dealer that provided him with his fix. The story of APB, sadly, is not that much different.  I stand now with a precious handful of survivors that took the train and never got off, and it is from this seat that I can humbly nominate APB Reloaded for the 'Monument To What Could Have Been' award.    Nothing further, your honor.",1,1

338180,Batla,"This game gets a slightly bad rap, I feel, for a few reasons.  1 - The game is almost entirely populated by Russians, but that matters little, as you will be speaking/typing infrequently. 2 - It's not exactly a standard FPS, it's very fast paced and the guns are very light. 3 - Technically, people who have played longer will be at an advantage due to upgrades that you use the credits you recieve when you finish games to buy - but it's not pay to win.  However, I would hardly call it a bad game. It's free, to begin with. It's got fun, fast paced gunplay, with lots of room for mechanical outplays when being played by good players. The guns each have their own unique personality, and they all feel fun to use. To be frank, it's more fun than a lot of triple A FPS games I've played.  The servers are near abandoned, however, so come into this game bringing friends. Ignore the other reviews for this game, and give it a shot. It's not half bad.",1,1

203810,Dear Esther,"Not so much an interactive game as an exploration into tragedy, loss and grief told through one man's journey across a desolate, Hebridean island. Dear Esther is more like a form of slow and very intentional interactive art, akin to viewing a captivating painting where you're suddenly allowed to step inside the frame and experience the scene in its entirity as you desire rather than be confined to just one perspective.  The story is conveyed in fractured pieces of spoken memory of old letters - or possible delusion - and left to the player to construct for themselves as different readings are presented at specific points along your journey, the semi-random nature of these readings meaning multiple playthroughs are required for them to be fully imparted to you.  Touching and visually captivating in equal measure, Dear Esther is a brief yet nonetheless poignant example of how the medium of gaming is more than capable of producing beautiful and contemplative works that can provoke great emotion, backed by a strong musical score setting the perfect wistful tones to accompany the bleak isolation and inward reflection of the journey. If you have the interest and willingness to explore such things then this will reward you greatly.",1,0
243470,Watch_Dogs,"This is a tough review to write for multiple reasons, but I've finally put in enough time to feel comfortable giving the thumbs up or thumbs down that Steam craves.  At it's heart, Watch Dogs is an open world game based on one principle idea: The True Cost Of Technology. It's a potentially deep subject to cover and, despite how prevalent it is in the world, many games don't attempt to talk at length about how our reliance on modern machinery and tech in general affects us.   Sadly, for all it's lofty goals, Watch Dogs is more an open world game that beats it's message into you rather than a contained story involving true thought provoking techniques and ideas.   It is a graphically impressive game, full of reflective surfaces and mostly smooth frame-rates, but the world still manages to feel dead despite it's population. The easiest example of this is anytime you drive a car near a curb with people nearby. The first time someone mocks you for driving so 'badly,' you may get a feeling of immersion. The fiftieth, often from multiple people saying it at exactly the same time? Not so much.  It may seem like a small thing but the repetition the game brings will wear on you, and do so quickly. Pedestrians are often obvious color palette swaps of one another, the facial models and even clothing worn multiple times in the same crowd. Whatever their reasons for this, the developers of Watch Dogs managed to create a world full of people...that don't make you think of people at all. Instead, they are marionettes. Their strings tugged to make them move in what could almost be considered a lifelike performance.  The game play itself, outside of this full yet somehow artificial world, is once again at odds with itself. The game tries very hard to sell you on your character's skills and feelings about how those with power use it but, at the end of the day, he is an amoral man who does things just as bad (often worse actually) than the people he is claiming to fight against. An example is how you are often asked to stop crimes in progress, only to turn around and hack the person  you just saved  so that you can drain money from their bank account to add to your own. The game makes no mention of this being so obviously wrong and hypocritical, but it's there all the same. Story beats follow much the same path, asking you to do things it frowned upon only seconds earlier.   On that topic, the story itself is a mess. Considering what I've just mentioned and in how it's told to begin with, the line between what you do and what you're adversaries do is so thin already but the plot's pacing does it no favors. Characters will be killed off or introduced in ways that make little sense, breaking what little flow the game is trying to maintain.  All this being said: There is a good game in here somewhere. The controls work well, the shooting is tight and, like I mentioned, the graphics are well done. In addition to all that, when the hacking angle is played well, it's a really fun time. A perfect example of this is the 'Song Sneak' app that the game makes a part of your cell phone. If you're near what sounds like a new song, whether it's playing on a newsstand or from a nearby car in the game world, you can start the app and it will add the song to your available playlist. It's a small feature but it shows potential for innovation further along in the series.  I mentioned at the beginning of this review that it was a hard one to write and that is really for one main reason: For everything that it could have been, Watch Dogs is an open world game that falls too easily into one of many generic descriptors. I hope that a sequel is in the works, if only to see this idea given a proper showing but, as it stands now, I can't recommend the game to anyone unless they've got a great deal on it, an empty weekend or, sadly, both.",-1,1

235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"At first I was enthralled by it. But after some repeat games, and lacking rewards I find the game is missing quite a bit.  Pros    Great design.  Level design is solid. Character design is great. It all fits together nicely in terms of direction, and how things play out.    Satisfying gameplay.  Cutting or blasting your way though mobs of Skaven is very satisfying. Taking off heads, making those precision headshots when an enemy is rearing for an attack on you. It's all good. It adapts Left 4 Dead's system of gameplay, except for finding weapons in the maps. What you start with is what you get. You find things like healing items, buff potions, and bombs.     Great audio.  Soundtrack, voice acting, weapon sound effects. It's all good. Not much to say here. Certainly nothing to complain about.    Devs do communicate  on the forums, are aware of the bad loot system, and are already planning a fix for all of it. This is a huge deal.    Not Good/Bad    The Loot system.  It's a great idea I wish we would have seen in Left 4 Dead games (I also wished you had a persistent inventory). But what keeps it from remaining in the Pro list is that it's completely unreliable, and sometimes, downright insulting. It's consistent at best. You may get the roll you want off of playing a single game. You might get trash items for hours. You might conquer a tough map with grimoires/tomes and still get nothing. It doesn't reward you for an honest games work. RNG can be great in games, but while player enjoy the 'luck' aspect of some games, its not a great platform to make your characters depend on when it comes to progression. It needs modified in some way.     Linear.  If I recall L4D correctly, I remember branching/changing paths in some missions. Meaning it wasn't necessarily the same game over and over. I don't see that here. And while its great to be familiar with the game, once you've played each level a couple of times, there isn't much to look forward to. You're just focused on finishing the map, so you can see if you can get a good roll, and get that Rapier you want.   Cons     No real RPG system.  No perks, no stats, Don't give it a level-up system and call it an RPG if it really isn't one.    Small weapon selection.  There needs to be a lot more. Thats all that can be said.     Bugs.  They happen. Game breaking bugs. Where you're just simply walking, and then you're simply dead and unable to be revived.     Missing basic multiplayer features.  There doesn't seem to be any votekick. It just host has all the power. Mic use doesn't reliably work either. Sometimes I can talk to my team, sometimes I can't.     (Pet peeve) Devs: When I Alt-Tab out of a game.... I don't want the game to be set in Bordered Window mode.  FIx that ♥♥♥♥. It's annoying.     No Offline mode.  You can play singleplayer, with bots. But you have to be online. It's 2015, devs. There's not really an excuse anymore for not having your game completely Offline capable. Get with it.     Summary: I can recommend the game, but don't expect much from it. If you plan on playing alone, with pub players you probably won't get much out of it. It can get repetitive, and the rewards for all your hard work are not gaurenteed. But you can enjoy hacking and slashing your way through droves of enemies. The game is gorgeous and plays well. It just needs some more content, and some moderate tweaks to what it has now to make it a fully replayable and deep game.",1,0

404790,Godot Engine,"I do game development since several years. I jumped from one engine to another. With Godot I finally can develop a game on Linux from the start to the end. It's still a young game engine but it has an incredible development pace. I follow its development since last year through GitHub, Facebook and I have to say what others say as a marketing term this game engine really does democratizing game development. It's open source (MIT License) without strings attached, the main developer(s) listen to the community and welcoms everyone who wants to help in the development, documentation and growth process.   Some technical notes: When we have to talk about the technical stuff right now the 3d stuff is really just at the start (although If I take a look around what people often produce with other game engines they could easily do the same with Godot) . One Problem as of now are the shadows and performance in large scenes. That said the 2d part, the custom scripting language, the editor (written in Godot and its GUI itself which proofes the power of it) everything fits so well together. If you come like me from a background with other game engines then you might need some days to fully grasp the concept and its underlying power. But then it makes just click and you see a really powerful game engine that has a lot of potential to become a serious competitor even for commercial grade games. The actual renderer is based on OpenGL (ES) 2.0, which as of right now is perfect for targeting Mobile,Webbrowsers (seems that most WebGL implementation are on par with OpenGL ES 2.0) and of course the desktop. There is an upgrade (and rewrite) planned for the 3d related stuff to OpenGL ES 3.0 which will come with Godot 3.0. In my opinion a lot of people underrate the possibilities with the actual renderer. I'm sure we will soon see some people prooving to be a good alternative to other game engines out there. (And let's not forget it's free to use without big restrictions like a lot of other game engines)  Scene nodes concept: What I love about Godot is the scene node concept it follows. A lot of engines have some kind of scene node or scene graph based concept. But Godot makes it in a really simple and yet smart way. A scene consists of multiple scene nodes (of all sort of types of nodes for 2d,3d,gui, own defined with modules etc.) . A scene can also contain other scenes within its hierarchy. The keyword here is 'instanced scenes', which allows to add scenes in other scenes and people can work on different parts of a big scene without having to fear to break the scene hierarchy, it's really great. Together with Godots use of source version control friendly file formats this makes for me a great choiche for a collaboration. (Be it a collaboration for a commercial game or a game for a game jam). I love the scene node concept as it's main goal is that with one look at the hierarchy you already know where everything is and how it is organized (try that with componend based design where you have to first select objects (and find them first) before seeing which components they contain.   GUI: In some simple words: smart, powerful, easy The editor has everything you need to layout things. GUIs can be 2d on top of 3d content (like we see in every game) or it can be 2d within the 3d content. You need a menu on a display which is made as a 3d model? No problem. With Godot it is easy to set it up. I saw recently a demo where a guy made a 3d game where there was a tv and game console in a room and you could start playing a 2d game on that 3d modeled tv. So a game within a game. I know it's also possible with other game engines, but with Godot it's really easy to set these things up, the editor is just easy to use.  Everything can be animated: With everything I really mean everything! Every kind of property can be animated (so it will be interpolated if the values are float based, set and unset if they are boolean like etc.), But also function calls can be part of an animation track. Animating is so easy just some clicks and you have a animation ready to play. I made a simplistic day/night animation for instance in just 2-3 minutes lol  Extendibility: You can write plugins in GDScript (Godots own scripting language which has some similarity with Python but is not Python as it is a scripting language made for game development).  And you can develop modules in C++. If you had problems integrating C++ libraries in other engines, you might be surprised how easy it is to do it with Godot, thanks to the nice binding functions offered by it.   My opinion so far: My opinion is that we are seeing the start of what can become the Blender of the game engines out there.  If you need a high performance hardcore graphic solution for a game with large scenes then Godot might be the wrong choice rigth now. But it doesn't hurt to try it. It's easy to learn and you don't need to register any account with it.  I'm happy with it. Btw I used Unity, Unreal and Cryengine among other game engines and while I think that they are far superior in some areas especially in 3d rendering, I also think that they could learn a lot from Godot's simplicity of use and how it organizes some stuff.  As of now you can use it without any doubts for every kind of 2d game, 3d game (if not ultra realistic hardcore graphic is aimed- which will be possible only later on), mobile games for iOS,Android and even Blackberry. Browsergames (so you can develop 2d and 3d games without needing a plugin). And it runs on the typical 3 operatin systems for the desktop: Windows, Linux and Mac OS X plus people even made ports for FreeBSD, Haiku (which a lot don't even know it exists) and someone tested it on Raspberry Pi too. This is possible thanks to the permissive license.  I made my choice and I guess I will continue to use it for a long time. I feel that this game engine has potential to become really important. But again as said try it and valuate it if you need more or if it has everything you need right now.  What lacks is still the documentation but it's getting better and better, we'll see",1,0

313340,Mountain,"A mix of thriller and an mmorpg (potential wow-killer), Mountain covers the life of Mountain, from birth to ultimate annihilation. You take care of Mountain by cleaning it, taking out the trash, and help its singing career, which could save it from the apocolypse. In its lows, fish and fire will rain from the sky but if you are good enough, you can make it rain cold hard cash (coins). If you are the type of player who likes to see things burn, lead Mountain to its demise.   I would only recommend this game to those willing to put a lot of time and effort into grooming your Mountain into success. Those who only play this shortly without allowing this game's amazing depth and quality influence your life indeed are very poor souls. In my personal experience, it takes several hundred hours with this game to fully experience it.  I have only completed Mountain a couple of times in the time I've played, and I hope to get a lot more in the future. I can easily recommend this to anyone willing to sell their souls to the Mountain. 10/10 would sacrifice myself to the mountain again.",1,0

I recommend this game for Artistic styles and music in it. The storyline is non-existent, but i feel this game does not need a storyline. It just involves a bug evolving into different forms.  Also, for those who are card hunters, this game has card drops, but be aware, you may have ti 'wait' awhile for them to drop..

203160,Tomb Raider,"Ok first the bad since I recommended it. If you hate shaky cam or have motion sickness issues, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I nearly gave it a thumbs down because it's so bad, and you can search and find a LOT of people complaining of feeling sick trying to play it. My trick to that is walk instead of run, which isn't terrible since it's real easy to miss things and get in trouble just running right in. I do wish walking was slightly faster though, walking is more like sneaking. The other complaint I have is the 'quicktime fights'. Now a lot of people are familiar with these and don't mind them, I personally hate them. In this game they are mind numblingly stupid and should have been just cutscenes instead. There is only one outcome, you have to mash keys in the right order at the right time with no warning, so it takes about 6 deaths to get through each one memorizing the key pattern each time you make it past the next key.  Ok all that said, the game is otherwise amazing. It looks incredible, easily some of the best graphics I have ever seen. Lighting, movement, weather, everything is just stunning. Gameplay is fun and engaging. A perfect mix of combat, gathering, crafting, exploring, and survival. And, there is no HUD, just the game world, which is amazing.

It does so many things right and has such a good swashbuckling wonder filled adventuring sort of feeling to it that you'd be mad to overlook it.  I remember buying this game in the bargain bin when it was still on the last gen consoles and feel I must have been in a bizarre place in my life to not give the game too much of a chance. I guess the shoddy frame rate didn't help matters either. However having picked this up recently on PC thinking it'd be another game destined to sit in my steam library for months with '0 hours' played in the description I've been unable to put it down!   Firstly the presentation for a game hailing from back in 2012 is actually surprisingly excellent. It might lack some of the finesse and polish of present day games but there's a surprising amount of relatively complex geometry occurring in the environments which is something that is glaringly absent when replaying last gen titles recently. Flat uninspired surfaces with equally uninspired basic textures are fairly indicative of the 7th gen consoles in many other open world games so its pleasant to see this game proves to be an exception (probably one of the reasons for the tanking frame rates on PS3 and 360).   Speaking of which, the frame rate is buttery smooth at 60fps now on PC and it looks like you should be able to achieve this on fairly modest hardware despite the recommended system requirements. Texture work is also surprisingly sharp given what I've heard from other sources around the web. Graphically the game really delivers for its price point and you should have no problem getting immersed in its world. From winding wooded trails to damp dripping caves the art design and atmosphere is excellent.  Gameplay is super fun especially once you've started acquiring a number of skills and discovered the never gets old ability to clamber on enemies and attack them a la monster hunter with super smooth animations tieing everything together beautifully and believably. The main issue I personally have with the combat is the lack of a dodge roll functionality (the dark souls vet in me misses my I frames).   Honestly I can whole heartedly recommend this game and it seems like Capcom have done a tremendous job with the port and even give you the option to play in 4k which shows they've put some thought into bringing it out into the current climate.   Incidentally, this is definitely one of the most authentically D&amp;D style experiences you'll find in a 'AAA' RPG with cheesy companions and dialogue abound and mythical creatures under every stone!",1,0

38410,Fallout 2,"In some ways, this is a direct improvement over the first. There is more stuff to do, more stuff to unlock, bigger map, etc. The character customization is deeper. That's all fine.  However, what I appreciated about the first game were its simple objectives with various free-form solutions. Fallout 2 seems to strip these away in favor of increasingly complex and awkward quests. Often, they will require speaking with specific characters who are almost indistinguishable from other, less important NPCs, and doing so in a specific procedure. The Gecko Power Plant quest is a good example of how this, combined with a lot of tedious running around, results in a tiresome game of 'who's who'. Of course, the player usually has a choice in these sorts of situations to take a moral shortcut for negative karma, but the rewards for pursuing a 'good' outcome pretty much always outweigh the rewards for 'bad' behavior. I prefer to finish quests in as complete a fashion as I can, but their weird, constricted structure here bores and angers me.  Other times, logic is sacrificed for the sake of creating gameplay. I understand that Vault 13, literally a hole in the side of a mountain, could be easily ignored, but if this Pipboy is the same one that belonged to the Vault Dweller, wouldn't it make sense for the locations canonically visited in the previous game to be on it already? At least the military base should be on there, if not the vault, but at least it's not hidden to the point of requiring a quest for exploration; Speaking of bases, what about the Sierra Army Depot? It sounds and looks like it would be big enough to be noticed just by going near it, but nope, it only appears when a certain quest is activated. There's also the Enclave power armor that's good at fooling Enclave soldiers in every situation save for the map's random events, but whatever, I'm sure someone with nothing better to do has come up with an explanation for all this. Bottom line is, the first game did not do this sort of thing. It let the player reap the full benefits of accidental discovery.  A large map is good, but the random events happen WAY too often. I breathe less often than I encounter something on the map screen. Almost every time, the enemies appearing in these events are too hard (instant death), too plentiful (slow, agonizing death), or easily outrun (waste of time). Save scumming becomes a necessity for travelling through particularly brutal areas, such as the region around Navarro, where movement needs to be taken an inch at a time, lest I come across a patrol and get a one-way ticket to the game over screen. Get the car, because that ♥♥♥♥ happens a lot less often, although there is still the occasional stop made involuntary for whatever reason.  Overall, the game is representative of living in modern day California; It's buggy (frame drops, some crashing), very disorganized, and constantly frustrating, but it has its moments, and it gets more fun after the first few hours. Bigger? Yes. Better? Maybe. It's still worth playing.",1,0

303210,The Beginner's Guide,"When I opened up this game, I honestly didn't know what to expect. The further I got into it, the less I could look away.

I can honestly say the two hours I spent on this game at 1 to 3 in the morning were some of the best videogame experiences I have had period.

311690,Enter the Gungeon,"This is the game I wanted Nuclear Throne to be.  It plays very much like that, but is a true roguelike, which Nuclear Throne is not.  If you have played Nuclear Throne, or its freeware prototype Wasteland Kings, then you'll have a good idea what to expect. The general controls and gameplay are nearly the same.   There are a ton of different guns to find, as well as a ton of passive and active use items. You start with four classes available to you (five if you count the co-op only class) and there are a couple you can unlock. Since it's a roguelike, it also has permadeath and you're gonna die a lot. This isn't an issue, though, as the game keeps giving me that 'just one more run' feeling.  The enemy roster is pretty varied, and they all have different and unique bullet patterns, which really make them interesting. This also helps keep the game fresh, as two rooms with enemy loadouts that are nearly the same but not quite can play totally different.  There is an in-game book that logs all the items you find, and things you kill. Each has a bit of flavor text, which help add to the lore of the game, which is a nice touch.  This game has one really huge negative, which is the utterly confusing lack of online co-op. If this would get addressed in a patch, this would be a near perfect game for me.",1,0

350780,MANOS: The Hands of Fate ~ Director's Cut,"This is my only serious review because this game is on several of my friend's wishlist and I want to warn them.  This game is really horrid, it's basicly everything wrong with NES homage games. It looks ugly as hell, the game design seems intended to kill you instead of giving you a challenge to deal with. Even if this game was made bad in a ironic way, there is no actual fun to be derived from that. The only humor in it is 'Did you see this MST3K episode? Well here's a reference to that'. Which I wouldn't mind if I was speaking to my nerd friends, but just saying 'look at these funnier people and what they joked about' does not constitute as a good joke for it's own premise.  About half the levels take place in the dark with only a small cone of light around you, which wouldn't be so bad if your cone of light wasn't barely bigger than your character. This creates a large amount of problems because the game just loves to throw enemies at you that knock you back into pits. You could potentially deal with this problem by just shooting what's coming up, but a lot of enemies home in on you from above, where you cannot shoot or are outright invincible. The final level is a auto-scrolling level that goes up, while you can't see what's actually appearing above. If you go too fast you will not notice the ball and chain that has just spawned that will knock you back all the way. There is a moment where they do this twice, one after another.  There is one level which is a plane level where you control a huge ♥♥♥ plane that covers atleast 1/6th of the screen. You die in one hit and it is nearly uncontrollable. The boss of that level is a giant chicken head and a plane which shoots small bullets you can barely see.  The game also just loves to cheat, early on there is a boss which changes your invincibility period to half a second, thus causing it to hit you multiple times if it so deems. This boss also is later reused in another game made by the same developer, so that tells you the effort put into it.  The music is decent, though. It's functional and does it's job well, never sounding unpleasant. However, not the same can be said of the sound effects. There is one enemy in the game that has a noise that can be accurately described as 'Screamer midi as back in the dial up days'. There is a UFO enemy that's spawned everywhere in one level that just the most painful noise known to man.  If you want to get a good homage to old NES games, I would suggest Shovel Knight. It is a better game than most NES games. If you want a funny bad game, just play Bad Rats, it's better than this is ever gonna get.  Oh also, the game outright didn't want to accept my DualShock 3 controller, no matter what program I used or input I set it at.  Update: As of this date, the dev has personally told me that they added a health bar to the plane level, this atleast negates my criticisms about that part. (Also 69% found this review helpful right now which is in fact Very Nice)  Update 2: The dev of this game tweetsearches himself and whined about this review for 3 days on his twitter. Got blocked when I told him in 3 different ways to stop tweetsearching himself. I have pretty much done what every game journalist sets out to do, so I now know what career I have perfected.  Update 3: He apologized, we all good.",-1,1
289090,Ampu-Tea,"This game isn't worth $5. Maybe $1 or $2, but not $5.  The game is just using the principle from Surgeon Simulator: you have specific control over a hand, and you must perform a task while trying to get a hold of the odd control method. Except in Ampu-tea, the goal is to just make a cup of tea rather than performing various surgeries.  One of the problems with Ampu-tea is that the (supposedly prosthetic) hand isn't attached to anything. You can just make it fly around the room like some sort of... I dunno. Helicopter? Flying Insect? Anyway, the game doesn't have any proper limits on where the arm can be moved.  Another issue is the lack of any sort of menu. You have a text box in the top right corner of the screen telling what certain keybings are (changing difficulty, disabling music, etc.), and a menu that pops up when you first start the game asking what language you want. Other than that there are no menus, and even then, the language select menu doesn't have mouse control, and is operated through pressing keys such as F1, F2, F3, and so on and so forth. There are also no performance options, you can't even change the screen resolution, leaving you with some pre-determined resolution rather than what your monitor actually uses. Another thing: people are saying that the translations are terrible for the different languages. I only speak english, so I can't tell for sure..  The game assets are weird too. There's a bunch of stuff on the table that has no reason to be there that could harm game performance on slower machines. Examples of these things are: random cloth rags with the words 'keep calm and make tea' on them, an 'out of order' tea kettle, and one of those horse head masks that are so popular on the internet (seriously? putting in an irrelevant internet meme just for a giggle?  It's not even funny in this context. ). Also, the devs supposedly had to increase the gravity in the game just because everything in the game wasn't scaled properly (as in, everything is smaller than it should be).  The scenery consists of a terribly-made room with bad texturing (seriously,  just look at that fridge. The texture used on the front is used on the side, too! ) and way more free space than you need.  The overall game lacks content and isn't executed very well. This shouldn't be on steam, this should be on a website like kongregate or something.  It's just not worth spending money. ",-1,0

246700,,"These kinds of games are rare, and beyond that, these kinds of games that are revolutionary, are rare. What kind am i refering to you might wonder?  Well, steep learning curves, solid and true pvp, and no holds bard glorious pvp action that gets your blood pumping even when losing, there is just something about bieng completely outnumbered, that pushes you beyond your capabilities, forces you to pull deadly death defying lunatic manouvers around these elaborate well thought out complexes. they have thrown in plenty of small gaps for you to brave in the middle of a dogfight, every single game i find myself ninja through one at least once. And the real kick to the teeth, I SUCCEED!  People say the controls suck, i completely and utterly disagree, if i am capable of these insane, near impossible to pull off manouvers less than 10 hours into playing the game, How by the life and death of all that is genetic, the controls bad?  With the simple flick of the mouse you can preform a true barrol roll, immelmen, immelmen turn, all of it and it doesnt even stop there. they truly capture the elemement that proves, up and down are non existant and throw that into the gameplay that allows for a wicked fun time. This game needs more support yes, its player base is struggling, and im enjoying it during the sale that has boosted the population.  Please people, stick with it! this game with new content will pathe the way for future games and can become so much more than it already is!  you might think with the steep learning curve that the game will be annoying, tough, and will force you to rage quit, well sure there have been plenty that have done just that, but i believe they all have one thing in common. they didnt sit down and try out the controls in a safe enviroment, they took one look, died, and quit. it doesnt take long to get to grips with the controls.  Just play a challenge mode if you hate tutorials like i did, by the time you finish it, you'll be ready to at least, survive, and pull off the insane manouvers that i refer to completely by accident and succesfully!  So now you might be thinking, if these crazy and insane manouvers are possible, then surely it must be nearly impossible to kill with weaponry such as miniguns, unguided missiles, and so on. again, not true, this game offers a really cool weapons choice to fit your playstyle no matter what it may be, if you used to play Air rivals/SCO you can don the B-gear cape once again and use free fire rockets, shotguns, and point blank people, or simply directly blast them in the face, and this is so easy to do, the game becomes somewhat a joust with these weapons.  the miniguns and contact reliant weaponry, dont let the shakeyness fool you, its easy to do. you get behind an enemy, and you can follow him, any manouver he can pull, you can too, you can cut the corners of his manouvers easily, catch him and kill him. you'll be doing it in no time i assure you, this games learning curve is not as steep as you might think.  For those too lazy to read through the entire review, fair enough, lazyness is in overabundance these days.  The game is easy to learn, hard to master. it is great fun. You can pull off break neck manouvers with ease and more succesfully than ever. You can succesfully follow these manouvers with easy, thereby adding far more depth to pvp combat counters to counters to counters. Aiming isnt nearly as hard as you might think. Weapons that are similar to the amazing B-gear of Air rivals, SCO, Ace online.(same game different servers)",1,0

270880,American Truck Simulator,"American Truck Simulator feels more like a downloadable add-on for Euro Truck Simulator 2 than it does a standalone game.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has played ETS (The $19.99AUD pricetag is more than justifiable), or those that are on the fence about whether to purchase a truck simulator or not.   Should you be a newbie, and faced with the choice between ETS 2 and ATS, I'd strongly recommend going with ETS 2.   New additions such as police cars that become portable speed cameras and roads that become flooded with tumbleweeds give a fresh feel, but it's still just ETS 2 (not that that's necessarily a bad thing).   7.5/10  tl:dr - It's a good game, but glorified DLC for ETS 2.",1,0

And well... it is and it isn't. It took me less than 3 hours to 100% the game, minus a few odds and ends achievements that I could go back and do in less than 10 minutes. Don't buy this if you expect a good value for your money, because 5 dollars an hour is more expensive than the average movie time to price value. Laughably easy, a story that seems shoehorned in to try and keep the gameplay in line and a gadget variety so small you really do feel like a spy on a budget. Don't expect the gameplay to change from switching light switches to doors and cameras to doors until the last level, where a 'big' surprise lies in wait for you. (Hint: It's not that big, but it changes how you can tackle early levels.)  Shortcap: In less than 3 hours you can A+ every level, get 95% of the achievements and crush the story without mercy. Not worth 10 bucks, but 5 dollars or less it's a solid buy, especially if you're a big supporter of indie games.  I'm a little disapointed by the creator, as this game could have gone seriously far.

There are also two nice features at the bottom of the page, a diary and main story quest log, so the player can keep track of the storyline.  The Hidden Object scenes start out with 3 items and the items increase at each level. Also the player is encouraged to chain the object finds to increase the 'prizes' of XP, money, items, and energy. A special area feature is the little picture by each area name indicting the type of HO scene available. 'Sun' is straight find list. 'Hand and sun' Silhouette mode. 'Moon and stars' Night mode. This makes it much easier to know, find and anticipate certain modes when needed for quests.  Much easier play style compared to other games of this type, with far less grinding then usual and who can beat the price of FREE, so give it a try if so inclined.",1,0

273070,The Last Federation,"The BEST worst (or worst BEST) purchases I've ever made.  PROLOGUE OF THE REVIEW: After reading a ton of reviews, seeing some gameplay vids, I've concluded those people are just shills trying to make an 'avant garde' game sound like something it totally isn't.  Why would they do that?  Because no one would buy this FRIGGIN' type of game as-is, at-all, ever--if they truly knew what genre it is. UNLESS, they've been duped into buying it cuz others have misrepresented its genre. OR, they're familar with this genre, or want something entirely fresh, or are cult-like followers of the developer (we've seen them folks around before, haven't we people?).  So this devolves into semantics, which is not good start for this game. It appears to me: fans seem to go out of their way to paint it incorrectly. Despite that, IS THIS a GOOD game?  GENRE IDENTITY CRISIS: First, let's clarify the game's genre. It's unique. That sums it up. In my opinion, it's a TURN-BASED PUZZLE GAME in a SCI-FI STRATEGY SETTING, with some ARCADE-LIKE ACTION SEQUENCES.  GAMEPLAY: You START out at the menu with a plethora of gameplay options. Honestly, these don't mean diddley squat because the game is like NOTHING you've ever played, it makes no sense to tinker around with any of this. Seriously. Instead, just try to pick what seems like the 'default' gameplay, and start. This way, you'll get an idea of how it is. If you want, you can adjust things to make it 'easier' for noobs, err, newbs. Which is hilarious because...  ...after you click through the pages of still images reading all the text telling the story, you'll be dumped into the game and have ABSOLUTELY NO BLOODY IDEA WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON.  There is a MAP of 'space'. Fans call it 'map of the galaxy'.  What a joke. It's roughly around 10 planets/locations.  SO, you play this monsterous alien hydra titan that looks like it could devour Cthulhu.  Your the last of a race whose world/people are wiped out, and you can work to unite the races or destroy 'em or whatever. You don't control 'your own empire'. You're more of guy 'behind the scenes' spending the entire game manipulating the other races.  Other races have 1 Planet.  NOT some 'empire'.  So how do you PLAY THIS? You basically spend almost the whole game clicking on menus.  You can click on the other worlds/places and you immediately 'zip' across to there. Then, you get to access THEIR menus, to see the things you can click on to do. Like: hire some guys, hire some researchers, help them develop something, sell them some tech, help with something else. Very detailed menus (and everything is detailed UP THE WAZOO with descriptions), explain the PROS and CONS of each option.  Approx. 80% or more of anything you find on any of the menus you are told YOU CAN'T DO, because you need to raise rep, or do something else, or get special points in something, and there's a huge plethora of INFO about each of those things to figure out what the hamhock-heck they are.  If you CAN ACTUALLY find something it WILL let you do...SHOULD you do it? AND THAT'S where the genius of the strategy/puzzle aspect encompassing this game is at! Doing an act, might lower relations with another race, for example. You might upset 'the balance' or whatever.  If you decide to do the act, you...CLICK to do it. Then, just spam END-TURN until a text pops-up and says something like 'OK, THAT'S DONE'. Actually, it's way more 'wordy' than that. But...'SAME DIFFERENCE!'.  So you see if you got credits or points in something, it goes from 500 to 625 or whatever. Big accomplishment! Rep with these guys goes 100 to 105 and THOSE guys, moves 95 to 85. Or whatever.  That's it.  At some point, you get to do other things. You just have to do all this kind of stuff alot. AND I MEAN, ALOT.  Making it easier, is you can set the 'End Turn' thing on a sort of 'AUTO-PILOT' so you don't have to tire your fingers spamming. Rather, the game will end the turn for you, sparing you the tediuous monotony.  Some 'things' you get to do, will take you to an 'ARCADE GAME' where you have to dodge spinning balls, and stuff. Reminds me of the simplicity of Space Rangers 2's 'Arcade Sequences', but in SPACE, like above a planet, with way better graphics. The Arcade Sequence, like most Arcade Games, plays out in 'real time'. Get hit too much by the bullet/object spam orgy things, you die.   So, don't let that happen!  After that's over, it's back to the 'space map', clicking on menus to see what else teh game will 'let you do'.  The SPACE-TECHNO soundtrack, makes this all feel REALLY important.  What makes this game so cerebral, is that YOUR decisions AFFECT the huge galaxy...of like around 7 measily planets. Maybe one races destroys another, ALL OF THE SUDDEN! Or destroys the one that are your puppets...it feels like a historical gaming industry moment!  Incredibly thought-provoking, worthy of thousands of pages of forum drooling!  So deep and provocative, and IN NO way randomly generated. It makes the game feel comparable to the Encyclopedia Britannica, reading Aristotle, or Homer.   No, literally on that first one. Just one page about anything in the game, is loaded with so much detail, it's like a novel. You should get a Steam Achievement if you actually read just one of the pages (in its entirety).  And some fans claimed this was a 4X game, where you build fleets and conquer them like in Master of Orion, GalCiv, and other well-known 4X games. Others, compared it to being 'just like Drox Operative' (which is an open-world ARPG arcadish space-ship game).  It ain't. Not even close! Others know FULL WELL, the type of game it is...like an overwhelming aroma that splashes into the mind, then swirls, and swirls around.  **OVERALL RATING** : E=mc^2 out of 10.  PROS: So many menus you get to click on, surrounded by really good static backgrounds with great artwork, some animations. Visually, it's very colorful. It's like reading a 1000 page Isaac Asimov dribble with rainbow rave-party club lights dancing on the pages. Sometimes GREEN txt, sometimes another color. The artwork is top-notch, the story setting itself is very good, and I enjoy the idea of playing some mastermind behind the scenes. The game offers differing gameplay types. Given how enriching the moving dots &amp; triangles on the 'space map' are, the entertaining evade and/or blow-up everything Arcade sequences are, I decided the route of wiping out everyone. (Any surprise?).  CONS: I can't think of cons with the game, but rather, with the rabid fans that misrepresent what type of game this is. THEY ARE THE REAL CONS. So are some reviewers with their videos, only showing the (few) 'mass-appeal' aspects of the game [example: skipping CORE GAMEPLAY, and showing only the 'arcade' sequences. Many 'REVIEWERS (and THE DEVELOPERS EVEN), do this]. That's really LOUSY. Many 'reviewers' give-up early (and maybe the DEVELOPERS TOO?) and say 'HEY, BUT IM SURE IT'S COOL AND YOU CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS LIKE SOMEONE ELSE SAID.' and then END their video.  In truth, they don't want to waste another minute to play it more.  That sucks of them. Right?  SO BEWARE all the false reviews. Take the time to watch an ACTUAL gameplay vid that's like AN HOUR LONG (at least), that DOESN'T EDIT OUT THE CORE GAMEPLAY (all the menu-clicking action).  CONCLUSION: This is a PUZZLE game at its heart, involving lots of menus, clicking and waiting for something to happen. You're more likely to have to take a dump before anything does.   There's nothing wrong with that.  You need patience.  If you're a NORMAL gamer who prefers DooM or CoD, you probably won't enjoy it.  If you're a gamer with SPECIAL NEEDS in gaming, with matured, refined tastes, you'll appreciate a slow, 'cerebral' challenge.   And if you love reading, like a vampire loves blood, this game (and this review...) WILL leave you sated and quenched.",1,1

The best part in the game which is replaced (counting out the graphic update) from the original is that the whole annoying part of not being able to fully customize your weapons is gone and replaced with the last light weapon system. My one problem with the game is that it's poorly optimized. I could run  last light with almost everything maxed out but this game I have to turn down the graphics and the like for a steady 60fps.   In short, aye I do recommend it but be aware that it's not that well optimized. Have a good time in the tunnels :)",1,0

248570,Toribash,"First impressions: When I first saw this game it looked fun. When I got ingame and learned the concept I was disappointed. The fighting was frame by frame were each frame you say what parts you want to move and how to move them. it was way too slow and no preset move could be made to make the game faster.   Online play: I tried online play to see how that was different from the dummy. Online play is so much slower. Only one person per server may play at a time, and many people will run the timer making games last way to long, also there are up to 10 people in a server, so you could have to wait for 9 people to finish up just to get one turn, and like me you may just loose that match you waited so long for match.  Cons: Slow paced, you only have one shot to take the enemy down, and if you mess up, even for only on one frame you are dead, takes waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to long to get to play online, the short satisfaction you get on winning is no compensation for the time you have to wait, and there is not to much satisfaction in winning.  Pros: Has a possibility to be a good game, concept is great, and the short time you get to play is entertaining.  Far to slow passed to be fun, the way the servers are set up make it even worse. I by no means think this game is worth anyone's time.  I'm sorry if your opinion differs, but this is how I, as a new player felt about the game. I had no fun at all.",-1,0
316010,Magic Duels,"Fun game; but, o gosh does the computer cheat its way to victory. Starts out easy enough, but after you play for a few weeks the computer consistently and conveniently draws the required cards to either (a) destroy all your creatures, (b) disable your creatures, or (c) summon a powerful creature nullifying the creatures you have. I played 16 games over the past 2 days and for a number of straight turns in a row I drew lands, the computer drew 1-4 rare cards in time. I’ve played magic for over 15 years and remember the days of Avatars, but this game really puts a stranglehold on the fun with the AI design. Woof! Fun for a magic addiction quick fix, but be ready for some pay walls and frustration ahead. ",1,0

I saw it on sale though and thought maybe I'll try it because bioware at least used to make good games like kotor. Man this game amazed me. This has easily become one of my top 3 games of all time. while the gameplay is a little outdated it's not unplayable by any means and features the best story I've ever experienced in a game. I would easily pay $60 for this game as it offers at least double what most games have now a days and also features the best dlc I've played too. The dlc is almost as good as the main game and could easily be it's own game based on how much is in it and how good it is. If you even slightly enjoy RPGs I cannot recommend this game enough.,1,0

Attack too agressively and you'll get hurt. You must time your dodges, attacks, and make use of all resources available.

269210,Hero Siege,"[My logged online hours do not reflect hours played offline.]  There should really be a sideways thumb for games like this, but previously before all the recent updates I would have gladly given the game a thumbs up. From when I personally had played the game, the mana update had come out and the game - as it was - was perfectly fine by me. Arena-style, RPG elements, the overworld, etc. had a pretty alright feeling to it so I have nothing to ♥♥♥♥♥ about there. Graphically it's quite pleasing on the eyes. HOWEVER, I have noticed that the devs don't quite know what to do with their updates.  The constant updates keep changing things about the game nearly every time. You barely have time to get used to the new update before something else gets changed, whether minimally or completely. There is no constant 'making the game better' through slight changes or community advice. It's game-changing changes that have kept me off from playing Hero Siege further. Oh, and it's nice that you can't even complete every act because someone thought it'd be cute to release the rest of the game as DLC. Cause that makes sense, am I right? It's like if Stephen King wrote a book but only release the first two-thirds and released every chapter as a full-length book thereafter.  But here are the positives that I previously enjoyed: + The mana system was FINE. ([-] HOWEVER, acking up the skills' use of mana is pointless for having said skills at said level if you can't even use them.) + The overworld is alright. Has portals per act. Rather pointless to have though, not much to do other than sell equipment from a vendor you can't buy things from so you're left to hunt EVERYTHING down yourself (not that that's bad but it is tiresome after a while) + Graphically pleasing. Would not be surprised if they degraded it back to 8-bit or 16-bit graphics because we were all about 8 years old when the first Pokemon games came out anyway and that's how old the devs are acting. + Bosses were fun... ish. Getting through an area and mindlessly mass-murdering creatures with families and waging genocide to get to the next area left me with a tingly feeling all in my body that made me feel fuzzy. It's kept me out of prison.  - THE DAMN UPDATES. - THE DAMN UPDATES. -THE DAMN UPDATES. - Oh, did I mention the updates?  Would I buy this game again? If you like math, the probability of me buying this game ever again is 2 to the power of infinity minus one to one against. So... no.",-1,0

253940,Septerra Core,"I played this game long time ago and bought the Steam version only to leave this review. This is an RPG, heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger and maybe some other JRPGs. Very similar turn based battles with combination attacks. Just like in CT, there's a robot character, girl engineer character, etc. But crappy plot/dialogue and insane amount of mind numbing, time consuming backtracking. I attempted to play this game several times, wasted tens of hours, never finished it, deleted after one or another boring fetch quest. And plot.. I can't remember much after all these years, but it involved some evil dude hunting for some macguffin and several characters dying while trying to give my character time to escape. Yes, this dumb cliche scene occured 2 or 3 times through the game. Pre-rendered 2D graphics in 640x480 sure looked nice in 90s, but were already dated at the time of release. Its main competitor, Anachronox, also a CT-inspired western JRPG, looks much better on modern PCs, in addition to simply being better written and more fun. Also suffers from backtracking, but has 'secret' fast-forward button to make it bearable. And this game.. I would not call it bad, but it isn't Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Xenogears, Fallout, Baldurs Gate, Planescape Torment, Dark Sun, etc. etc. So many great games, so little time.

Graphic : Amazing , beautiful views and art. Gameplay : Similar to the last one , alot of mini maps with trophies and secrets to unlock and explore. Plot : It's ok , could be better.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"'400 Bucks' achievement: 'I may be homeless, but at least I have a sick knife'  Congratulations Overkill. You don't even seem to understand irony, let alone your own fanbase.  Welcome to Payday 2 new players. Enjoy it while you can. In the future I wouldn't be surprised if Overkill starts putting a pricetag on masks, mask patterns, and materials. Anything they can do to continue making more money. Hell they will probably put special stats on masks if you fork over $50 or a few hundred dollars. People try to say 'OOOH WELL, WHO CARES? YOU CAN'T MOD THE SKINNED WEAPONS AND THE BONUSES AREN'T EVEN THAT BIG!' It's about principle. I was one of those people that didn't like how every DLC seemed to introduce the new, best weapons. The rebalance was mostly good in my eyes, save for things like them doing nothing to make the Saiga 12 (base game shotgun) anything but a lesser AA12 (DLC). So the original DLC advantadge is always going to be there. But now we have these stupidly rare skinned guns that are exactly the same as other skins except they have a bonus attached to them, making them more valuable. Oh and did I mention they are even more gaudy than the ♥♥♥♥ that gets submitted to CS:GO? I mean seriously who the hell designs this crap? No, I'm not going to use a gun that looks like it's covered in a pattern that belongs on a woman's purse. I don't care for these worthless safe drops at the end of a heist, even if it means I can earn $3 steam bucks from a drill drop now. I want masks, patterns, materials. INFAMOUS drops. Remember those? Even less of a chance of getting the cool stuff you want to make your ideal mask now. I should have downloaded goonmod and used their stupid coin system to unlock all the ♥♥♥♥ I wanted before this terrible update happened. It's great how they are trying to get away with it by implementing a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ the fanbase has been asking for forever. PDTH heists have been on everyone's wishlist. Being able to mark a lobby loud/stealth, etc. Don't forget adding the drill drops AFTER they tested everyone's reaction to it. What a sorry excuse for a resolution. I don't think I can make it to Infamy 25 at this rate...",-1,1
262410,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,"Well first off all. You thought an AK that you shoot in your came looked easy to make? Think again as you will be mesmerized by the small detail that you might find that even the lower receiver looks different when you see it again.  Payday2 users, modding a gun seems so easy and wonder why it's charged so badly? Well hoenstly to say I think I get why they are so expensive to do.  I barely got into the game that much, and I just barely unlocked the two guns at the start doing what I can do with them but so far it's fascinating.  Some say the other parts are bad such as the shooting range, but isn't that like a option that you are able to do? The title itself is pretty much self-explanatory 'Gun Diassembly' so, why really bother too much about those aspects as for those there are practically infinate number of shooter games that lets you have some experieance with it.   -------------------------  Be resdy to be frustrated though as when you first pick up this game it's going to be hard, like /really/ hard if you know nothing all all about guns. But if you are interested and want to know how in general things work, this just might be the game for you.  And it's free, it's still worth 10 minutes of your life or somethin.",1,0

I found the fast paced and challenging gameplay very much to my liking, and the action-filled gun-fighting never lets you down, even though it often leaves you face down in the dirt.  I greatly enjoyed that you could find your own way through some of the maps, figuring out the best way to deal with those that stood between you and your goal.

417860,Emily is Away,"Nice aesthetic. Cool pop culture references, including some that will hit you right in the nostalgia gut (dem MSN Messenger icons). The story is simple and straightforward, and one that I feel many of us may relate when it comes to situations in which we ended up just drifting apart from old friends despite still desperately trying to cling to them.  The downside is that Emily herself seems quite... 'confused', or even inconsistent at times (in one year she acts like she's bitter about this thing, the next year she seems to not want/not care about it anymore, then she's sad about it), and it's a little disappointing how your choices dont have that big an impact on the outcome and you just get that bittersweet end, no matter what.  It would be interesting to see an extended version (maybe a paid version) with more endings, more choices, and in which the side-characters play a bigger part (maybe you can chat with Travis, Mike, Emma et al.)  Still pretty entertaining though. It's also quick and hey, it's free, so why not try it out?",1,0

It shouldnt be timed it should last the whole level. the health system has 3 hearts that you cant get back which doesnt matter cause you will die in the water instantly anyway.

310790,Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved,"Geometry Wars 3 is a twin stick shooter, which is a genre that I have to admit I'm not very experienced with. I played the original on Xbox 360 but that's about it, so I can't really compare the mechanics to other games, but I've mostly enjoyed my time with GW3 so far.  Its quite a simple game, with no story to speak of. The player controls some kind of spaceship and has to shoot a variety of differently coloured enemies while trying to earn a high score. Destroyed enemies will leave behind 'geoms' which can be collected to increase the score multiplier. You die instantly if anything touches you and there are usually dozens of enemies on screen at a time, so its all about learning the movement pattern and speed of each enemy type, to avoid them.  There are 50 levels in adventure mode, which give you star ratings based on your score. Bosses are locked until you earn enough stars on previous levels, which normally I would consider to be a cheap way of extending a game, but GW3 gets away with it because most levels only last 2-3 minutes so replaying them isn't a massive inconvenience. There are also 5 'classic' modes that only have 1 map each, so their only goal is to set a high score.  The controls are designed to work best with a gamepad, so I used my 360 controller. You move with left stick and aim with right stick, and have super weapons on the two triggers which can be used a couple of times per level. You've got a supernova that instantly destroys everything on screen, and one other which the player chooses from a range of options. I liked the homing missiles because when the action gets really crazy, I didn't want to worry about aiming. I tried the mines and black hole but didn't really find a good use for them.  You can also choose between several drones that fly around and help you. The attack drone shoots enemies, and is useful when you need a bit of extra firepower, but I mostly used the drone that automatically collects geoms because the score multiplier is absolutely essential for earning stars.  The big feature for GW3 is the 3D design of the levels. While it looks impressive, it can sometimes have a negative impact on the gameplay. What I found is that many enemies spawn in places I couldn't see, so on small maps, fast moving enemies could kill me before I could react, and on large maps that have a time limit, hunting for an unseen enemy wastes valuable seconds.  The music is a good match for the fast paced action and I didn't notice any major bugs. Value for money is good. I finished the adventure mode in around 8 hours, and genre fans could probably spend countless more hours chasing high scores on the leaderboards for every map. And just before I was ready to post this review I've seen an article on IGN saying more levels will be released as a free update towards the end of March.  Overall I think Geometry Wars 3 is a pretty good game, and worth checking out if you're in the mood to just turn off your brain, relax, and shoot stuff.",1,0
246580,The Typing of The Dead: Overkill,"Hilarious, over-the-top and downright offensive, this unique shooter is just ridiculous enough to be completely entertaining from start to finish.   I almost couldn’t believe the premise of this shooter when I first saw it. Really…you kill zombies by typing words correctly? Although I’ve admittedly not played the House of the Dead games outside of arcades, I felt like I couldn’t pass up this opportunity when I saw it. I’ve never played the original House of the Dead: Overkill either, although it is baked-in along with this new keyboard-based game.   As far as game mechanics go, it’s pretty much exactly what it advertises – words will pop up on the screen above zombies, and your success is based upon how quickly and accurately you can key in those words. Your characters move from room to room on rails, sometimes barreling through an entire squadron of undead, other times not moving forward until you’ve essentially committed zombie genocide. This is one of the few games in which I feel the DLC is needed, as it increases the dictionary of words used with interesting themes, such as a Shakespeare pack or a sports lexicon. Some of the words and phrases are absolutely wacky, and I loved the challenge it provided for both my fingers and my mind.    As for the story – that’s where the real charm of this game is found. The entire adventure is presented as a grindhouse-style flick, and there’s a filter over the action that shows film noise and burns, which I felt really set a tone right from the start. Every cutscene is appropriately ludicrous and crass; the main characters swear and curse with incredible conviction, which is actually addressed within the dialogue itself during the few quiet moments between levels. Traveling between setpieces, the characters will occasionally make a comment on their situation, or their relationship in regards to each other. It’s an incredibly honest approach to the standard zombie apocalypse gore fest, and at one point the male protagonists recognize that they are stereotypical macho men going who have to save the strongest female protagonist. I really wasn’t expecting a type-‘em-up zombie game to have an interesting, existential view of the genre as a whole, and yet there it was.   Otherwise, the game is comparatively offensive and comical as an episode of South Park. You’ll hear scat jokes as you attack a giant-headed, wheelchair-bound, Stephen-Hawking-esque zombie, for example. But, the game stays so consistent with how ham-fisted it is with being distasteful that it actually is engaging and fun throughout. Had the game attempted to be serious and grim, it would have failed miserably.   I did attempt to play the original House of the Dead: Overkill which is included, but the options for controller support is very scant. There’s no option to adjust the reticle sensitivity, and as a result I felt like the crosshairs were flying all over the screen, even during slow-motion sections. It feels like the typing aspect of this game is the main attraction, which certainly isn’t a bad thing.   I don’t know the next time that one of these House of the Dead typing games will be released, but I enjoyed my time with this one so much that I’ll probably grab whatever comes next as well. Recommended for anyone looking for something entirely new to the shooting genre.",1,0

215770,Shad'O,"Shad’O isn’t a bad game, not by a long shot. It has everything you want from a tower defense. Plenty of various towers, plenty of various enemies to kill with said towers. It also has an interesting story-line and structure with some unique game elements. I just had two major issues with the game. The first was that the unique elements, while being thematically relevant, didn’t really add much to the gameplay itself, but only served as slight annoyances, hindering you in a way that other tower defenses don’t. This lead to my other issue with the game and is something I’m a little reluctant to complain about since it sounds whiny… but the game was hard.  Admittedly, Shad’O was a bit of a disappointment for me as it was a good example of poor game design and ‘game features’ that took away from the game rather than adding. An interesting story was developing in front of me and I’ll probably never see the outcome as I can’t get past the first chapter.

After you beat the game that should take you about 15 hours depending on how fast you play it, there are lots of DLC's to play to extend the time. And, you can play through the levels again completely differently. I have not encountered any problems with this game 10/10",1,0

222880,Insurgency,"This game, while not perfect in my view is a great close quarters tactical shooter, or rather it is when the players try and think that way. This game rewards tactical behaivior like fire and maneuver and punishes the rambos by filling them full of lead as they sprint across a killzone. I personally can only nit pick a few critisisms.  In combination with high damage and recoil environment which makes every contact a real threat, the game manages to introduce a reasonable and important customisation system where choosing your supplies is an important decision. This allows the various classes making up both teams to adapt to the situation and give the player some flexibility.  The night maps add a further element to the game play, forcing the player spend points on either a flashlight (which lights up the area and shows his position to the enemy) or night vision googles (which are expensive and can easily be blinded by light sources).  My only siginificant dislike for this game is the respawn system. Instead of operating on the ticket system (where on ticket equals one player respawn) the game respawns purely on a limited number of a respawn waves. While in some modes it is very effective, in others it results in a player being left out of the fight because he only died once all his team's respawns had been used. A mix of ticket and wave respawns would be better in my opinion. My other complaint is (in my case) what appears to be poor optimisation. Even Arma 3 seems to be more stable on my system.  Negative points aside, if you are into tactical shooters, I highly recommend this title game. However, if your definition of a 'tactical shooter' is the latest Battlefield titles or (heaven forbid) CoD, stay away from this unless you want to end up raging about the fact you can't 'n0 sc0p3' the guy 'camping' the road.",1,0

16720,Velvet Assassin,"Velvet Assassin is a great game with a lot of history to it. Look up the main protagonist's story before or after playing the game. I would recommend before, because if you're reading this, you likely haven't bought it yet.  The graphics and gameplay are great overall. I only had some trouble with Violette's hair displaying correctly for a while, but that was fixed. It was just my graphics card and some settings being dumb. The graphics are terrific considering it was made in 2009, and the gameplay is quite solid, but slow. You'll find yourself restarting at checkpoints (which are scarce, because this is based on a true story (I imagine that's why they're scarce in this game)) quite a bit. Changing weapons takes longer than it should, and the stealth part of the game is tricky.  Even though it took me literally years on and off (this was actually my first steam game), because I would either get frustrated with the stealth part *ENEMY INCOMING ALERT OUT OF NOWHERE!*, or I bought a new game that seems more interesting ( I don't usually finish things right away, so it could just be me), I would still recommend this game.

206440,To the Moon,"I would recommend this game if you are looking for a couple hours to kill sided with a desire to ride an artful, emotional rollercoaster.  I would absolutely NOT recommend this game if you are looking for an addictive, replayable experience. I would also not recommend it if you are looking for any depth of gameplay whatsoever. This is more of a movie-game than anything I've ever played so far. Everything other than gameplay, however is top-notch.  The story, as I've said, is an absolute rollercoaster in a wonderful way. I'm not going to say a word about it though, because this game would be 100% spoiled if ANYTHING in the story was given away before the director said so. It was artfully done. One criticism I might have would be that the humor can sometimes come at times when you didn't really WANT comedic relief. Your mileage of course may vary though.  The graphics successfully portray the colorful (personality-wise and visually) characters, as well as the physical (And sometimes not-so-physical!) surroundings. They never feel cheap or rushed, and are very pleasing in my opinion.  The music is astonishing, and elevates the experience to surreal heights.  The characters are very real, and you will feel close to them if you become immersed in the game (Which is really easy.)  The gameplay, as I've said, could be called a weak point. It's quite repetitive during the first half of the game (and onward sometimes,) and if there were no story, art, and likeable characters behind it, would be ultimately boring and uninteresting.  To conclude, this game is not like many others that I've played. I enjoyed it thoroughly, though at some points the story may make you feel angry, sad, or confused (which aren't always such enjoyable emotions, but important ones nonetheless.) You will probably walk away feeling wonder-struck, pensive, and satisfied.  For $9.99, I would recommend this game if you want the previously described experience. On sale?

239140,Dying Light,"I've played various free running games, and many zombies games, including Dead Island and Riptide, so this game should be home free, right? Well, not quite.  The game is gorgeous, there's no denying it. It's quite a step up from Dead Island, and DI was already quite serviceable. The voice acting is much better, and there seem to be fewer characters with endlessly repeating lines (and where they occur, they're less ridiculous).  The writing is a bit of a mixed bag -- there are some awesome, emotionally resonating bits (I liked the bit with the wizard, and the Kid who would be a Detective), and while there are a number of side quests you wouldn't realistically risk your life for, there are few where you'd like to punch the quest giver in the face for even suggesting it.  Unfortunately, the great let-down in the writing happens in the main plot, which is full of deaths of people who we didn't really get to know and like, or who are outright unlikeable, precluding any emotional response. To add insult to injury, one death scene takes essentially 10 minutes of exposition; that's worse than most operas! While the story told by the main plot generally makes sense and provides believable motivation for the protagonists, it falls through every time the plot centers on the main antagonist. It's not just that he is one of the weaker characters in the game in terms of writing; where usually, you have a choice of whether you want to avoid confrontation, used ranged weapons, or jump right into the fight, turning points with the antagonist force you into a style that may be quite different from you do in the rest of the game (and from what you bought skills for): Those turning points always seem to drop you in a pit crawling with zombies after taking some or all of your gear away ('You're exhausted, you cannot use the grappling hook.' 'You serious, bro? Isn't that when you'd use it most?') so none of your previous experience and fighting style will do you any good. It's quite tedious.  Where Dead Island gave you a choice of 4 characters, DL gives you just one -- quite a step back. Seeing as it's a first person game, it should've been easy enough to have e.g. a female character option, at the price of one more voice actor. Incomprehensibly, they also force a background on you, and that background isn't actually in free running. Consequently, protagonist Crane stinks at parkour for the first ten levels or so. He has no moves, and he's out of breath after sprinting a few yards (or, for that matter, swinging his weapon for or fives times). You're basically paying good money to play a free running game, and then the free running stinks for the first 10 hours. Well done. (I suspect Techland and I have just grown apart; I'd like another game that's fun, and they were presumably aiming for tension and challenge -- that's the charitable interpretation, anyway. Maybe Dead Island 2 will be more my speed.)  Another big factor in why that parkour just isn't that fun are the horrid controls. I don't particularly care whether the character automatically grabs on to ledges or whether you need to press or press-and-hold a button, but DL's putting jump and hold on the same button doesn't work for me. For a start, it makes climbing down a mess. Worse than that, 'hold' also tends to imply 'pull yourself up (onto the roof etc.)' which again may not be what you want. I've wanted for Crane to hang from a pipe, only to have him pull himself up and fall down the other side. Yay? As it stands, the controls seem non-deterministic, and factoring in the lack of full health regeneration, you're summarily discouraged from trying things out or building flow -- and of course, flow is a bit of an issue in the slums you start out in anyway. (See, same as your skills don't rate for ten levels, you don't get to the beautiful old part of the city that is densely packed with buildings of similar height until you're about halfway through the game.)  The one part of the game I did rather enjoy for a while was Be The Zombie. Figures, I guess -- as the zombie, you get decent movement skills, you don't have to play the meh protagonist Crane or play the equally meh story -- et voila, fun.  As it stands, Dying Light seems a noble failure, a failure at turning Dead Island into a AAA next-gen title. On the upside, Techland seem to've published tools for modders, so if that community evolves, it may turn one of the year's Greatest Misses into a hit after all.",-1,0
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"It's been a while since I've been into an online FPS game. The co-op nature of it is a _huge_ plus. Graphics are great, and the gameplay tends to be far more exciting than not when online. Surprisingly the bots are well designed and even if you don't have a full party, you don't feel like you're hindered.  If you approach it like a Quake-style shooter, or tend to prefer that kind of gameplay, you'll find yourself frustrated. The movement mechanics, while pretty freeing, feel still at the same time limiting. Movement speed, jumping, jet fuel, it's all balanced more on the side of 'slow and methodical' rather than high-octane twitch shooting.  I don't know if that style of movement/aiming is a product of the game having to work with a controller as well as keyboard, but it's nice to have the option.   Give this game a go if you're looking for something to grab a few friends with and take on bots or other players in 4 vs 1.  ",1,0

418340,RWBY: Grimm Eclipse,"I have been a huge fan of RWBY since the red trailer and for me this game has been great. It has a similar style to L4D and Dynasty Warriors. This is where some people start to hate the game because to them it feels like a watered down version of the two with very little content. I love this game because they aren't trying to do that, they use similar gameplay styles sure but they are building from the ground up. They aren't just throwing content out because people want it they make sure the content that they do put out will be worth it and have substance. As of now before horde and JNPR update I recommend playing this game with friends. It has a rank system where you have to grind through the game numerous times to rank up, which makes the repetative gameplay more fun because you have a goal to achieve. And if you don't have anyone to play with trying to beat the game on eclipse mode is a pretty fun (and annoying) challenge you can set for yourself. I recommend this game for; 1 people who love the show, 2 people who live hack and slash games, 3 people who like playing with friends (type of game that allows you to talk with friends and don't have to focus too much), and 4 People who like to grind through leveling systems and challenges (Mainly for singelplayer but some challenges have to be done in multiplayer).

The story is complex and filled with activities and online contains a strong story which slowly progress with you. Each little part of the game is balanced and fun to play. This is probably the only game I've ever finished the story for and I've played over 100 games. I've put more then 300 hours (100 pc and 200 on the XBOX 360) into this game and I believe if you chose to buy it you will definitely love it to death.

391270,Fingerbones,"This game has no jump scares, which is excellent, has some interesting atmosphere, which is nice, and as many have said, it deals interestingly with dark subject matter, but...  It's sort of trite? And I don't just mean in the sense that it's short enough to play through in 35 minutes or less. I just mean that, even with all the endless back-and-forth wandering it entails (and yes, you'll be walking the same routes over and over throughout play) and the creepy lighting and soundscape, it's just - short and simple, with not a real shock to be had. The ending, which I won't spoil here, becomes fairly obvious as soon as you're a couple of notes in, or if you have any basic sense of how these sorts of 'deep, dark, horrid secret' games almost always work.  The character whose jottings guide you around, whom you are probably supposed to be, is of the instantly-repulsive, pretentious sort, even before you learn the full extent of his misdeeds. I'm sure the point must have been to make you dislike this person from the moment you read what they wrote, or else things would have been far more subtle.  Basically, while this game is creepy and has nice atmosphere, it does nothing new with the sort of person who is revealed to you through the pages you read. It's the same sort of see-the-end-a-mile-away, 'AND THEN YOU WAS SKELETON!' writing that we've come to expect from atmospheric little horror games which can rightly boast no jump scares, but which then at the same time do nothing to shock that you couldn't just as easily see on the evening news or any article about very bad people doing very awful things to those around them.  Maybe, as a survivor of CSA, I'm sort of jaded, but frankly, this game is almost less horror, and more simply pointing out 'See, look! People are bad and do awful things to those they're expected to protect and care for!' with some 'horror' accoutrements in the form of creepy sounds and cobweb riddled, darkened rooms, and frankly, if you don't already realise in this day and age that there are plenty of horrific people in the world who already flourish doing the sorts of things that come up over the course of Fingerbones, and don't find the thought distasteful without needing indie horror games to remind you, then I don't know what to tell you.",-1,0

316010,Magic Duels,"I've played a lot of different card games on consoles and the computer and real life. Magic has always been one of my favorites, me and my friends used to play two headed giant for hours. The new magic game seems like a limited card pool, too many mechanics and bloated effects for the game to even be playable anymore. The grind for anything worthwhile is steep, online is a joke considering everyone either pays to win or already grinded for 100 hours.  In this day and age the game just isn't free to play enough, 10 matches against the pc for 1 pack ? I think not. So sad to see such a good franchise be thrown down the p2p slope, always hoped it would come back from that but it's progressively gotten worse.  The campaign is a laughing stock as the max gold you can get is 50 from the very end, by the end of one boring campaign you can buy exactly one pack.  The game is all about the $$$ for this game developer now, maybe one day they will wake up and release something epic with a thousand or so cards with tons of deck customization options and tons of a.i vs. human modes. Until then no more cash from me greedy developers.",-1,0

234140,Mad Max,"This game is not worth 50€, but it's still worth a look.  At first it feels really nice. Great atmosphere and scenery but the story is so badly written it sometimes hurts to watch cutscenes, especially at the end. I was so disapointed by the culmination of the game that I wanted to scream at my monitor 'What the hell is going on?'  As for gameplay after 30 hours or so I was so fed up with salveging scrap,blowing up tanks, pumps and whatnot that I didn't even bother to upgrade V8. You are just forced to do the same thing over and over again. The bosses are all the same, with the same mechanics. There are a lot of variants of enemies but basicly they are just reskins. On foot combat is a poor version of Arkham Asylum and Shadow of Mordor.  Another thing is that getting 3 pieces of scrap when you need 3800 is ridiculous and is obviously a cheap way to prolong the game. After some time most of the things in this game feels lazy and rushed. There are basicly 6 things you do in this game: salvage, blow things up in camps, pull down scarecrows and sniper towers and destroy convoys (which imho is the best feature fo the game). I am not counting quests because they are just longer versions of things mentioned above. Oh, and everything takes forever to do. Hold a key to kick a door, turn valve, eat, drink, open chest, build a project in a stronghold, fill up a car and of course pick up scrap.  The game left me really, really disapinted.  So to sum things up.  Pros: - greate atmosphere, - beautiful visuals, - greate cars' design, - on wheels combat.  Cons: - story (OMG, shallow and feels rushed), - dialogs, - Max is a bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥, - omg grinding, - wasteland encounters (those guys just talk and talk and they pretty much are useless), - on foot combat, - Max is a bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥, - the ending.

80350,Blackwell Convergence,"This is the last game in the series I've bought (so far), and while I know there are two more after, Blackwell Convergence is the best entry! It puts the previous ones to shame in many aspects, including music, storyline and art -- especially the art. It's so lovely and expressive! The music is great and definitely affects the mood of the scenes. Heck, I spooked myself accidentally when one piece started playing.  Even the puzzles/cases are more interesting, with every character playing some important part however tiny it is. (Everyone remember the first minor character in Blackwell Legacy and his not relevant part?) Granted, some of the solutions are harder to find within this point and click game. At least, for me they were. I had to look up a walkthrough for one, because it was hard to figure out what next step to take. This might deter certain people if they can't solve it in a fairly rapid manner, but I promise you, you'll be satisfied once you solve the puzzles/cases. I know I did, and that increased my enjoyment of this game.   The mechanics have also improved, and the animation as well. It's all very fluid. Kudos to the creators for being able to dish out a bit more money for the sake of the game, because it helped. A LOT! The voice-acting's improved too -- in the first game (and possibly the second one), you could literally hear mics crashing against the actors' breath or against something else. Here, there are no audio mistakes. It all sounds professionally done.  I'd recommend to anyone interested in this series to just start with this game...BUT that's a bad move, because unfortunately this game also depends on many plot points that have been brought up in the previous two games. (Also easter eggs will feel juicier when you find them!) Part of the joy in this game is seeing all previously established details come to fruition in Blackwell Convergence. The story (if you care about this more) depends on having played the first two games, in my opinion. It makes it a stronger, and more fun, game to play.  If you just want to have fun and possibly seek out the first two after, then play this first. But it's much more satisfying to play them all in order. THAT's the best suggestion I can give you.",1,0

377160,Fallout 4,"Fresh install gets stuck on the main menu loading screen indefinitely.  This is more of an FPS than an RPG, which is something I wanted from Fallout 4, but even though I don't care much for the RPG elements, the fact there are only 2 vital skillchecks, hardly ever an option of de-escalating a situation through diplomancy, and every door can be opened regardless of lockpick or science level because there's always a keycard in the exact same room, is just stupid.  The game looks awful, everything looks like polished plastic and the textures are muddy as hell, all the menus are just Fallout 3 reskins. Hair is one solid piece and facial expressions are incredibly robotic with lips often not syncing up to what's being said. The only positive graphical element is the particles, fire doesn't look great but the effect off lazers and plasma looks cool. Enemies are also balanced in a weird way, your most powerful weapon can usually take down a raider in a shot or two but then you come up against a raider that duct-taped a bit of piping to his chest and suddenly it takes 10 grenades and 4 magazines to take him down. The animations aren't exactly stellar either, everything from reloading to the cutscenes just don't look right.  The world is pretty boring, no interesting vaults to explore or unique areas. The best it gets is when you're in the middle of Boston, a few floors up looking out over the world and fighting enemies on the impromptu balconies of half destroyed buildings but even that's locked behind a few loading screens to get there. There isn't much point in exploring to begin with either considering you can just build stupidly powerful guns and that ammo never runs out if you follow the main plot.   The story isn't great, it's better than 3's which isn't exactly hard to do. You do reach a point where you're on the best of terms with each faction and they're all willing to help you out but it's made abundantly clear that after a specific point you have to side with one, it doesn't really make much sense to go beyond that point if you don't care about the story since you can jump between the factions and take as much help from them as you need.  The crafting system is okay, however the grind to find the smallest materials starts to outweight the enjoyment of building up a settlement rather quickly. I found the best way to enjoy it was to just cheat and give myself a stupid amount of building materials, although once you make your comfy settlement there isn't a whole lot to do with it, atleast nothing worth more than a curious glance over.  The game isn't very well optimised either, which is strange considering this game feels like what Fallout 3 should have been over 8 years ago, even stranger when you consider it's running on basically the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ engine. It runs well inside buildings but as soon as you step outside you can expect a ridiculous FPS drop. That's unless you fiddle with the settings to the point where the graphics suffer just so you can play the game at a bareable framerate in specific areas, despite it being fine in others.   Also shoutout to Todd's jewery for raising the price of the season pass just to cash in on the idiots who'd buy it knowing it was going up in price purely because it was 'cheaper'.   Don't buy this game. Even mods can't save it.",-1,1
388090,Five Nights at Freddy's 4,"Are you Nightmare Freddy for ready?  An amazing additional to the original quatriligy, fnaf 4 takes a fantastic approach to a whole new level, taking an original mechanic to the game and adding another. In this installment of the franchise, Scott (The creater/maker) took out the camera system and added a old mechanic of checking the doors with a light.  Pros: a good and challenging game to scare your socks off! Cons: Takes an amount of patience to succeed and leaves many questions unanswered.

256330,WRC 4 FIA WORLD RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP,"Even though the game tends towards a simulation, this should not discourage those players that do not care for car configuration or excessively realistic difficulty. Setting the player AI to 1 (from a maximum of 8), turning off most driving aids I was able to completely dominate each special stage, winning everything. So no frustration and the fun of experiencing the different tracks and cars. If you liked the DiRT series, this game can actually be easier to win (see above setting), but that it completely up to you. The visuals may be slightly older, but on my five-year-old PC (ATi HD 5850) the game runs at around 60 FPS solid, so no worries there.

If ever you feel like you've played too many of the same sort of game (shooters, tower defense, what have you) then this one will provide a welcome change.  Be advised, however: the game is buggy, regularly crashes to desktop, and can drag on in the latter half. After I defeated the final boss I was unable to pick up the thingie I needed because the screen containing the thingie was all black. Fought the boss again, same issue. Deleted the game in anger.

I haven't actually played it since then and I do keep meaning to get back to it but the prospect of dying and having to redo everything up to that point is kind of offputting me. Even so it was worth it just for that one day of play.  In terms of the style it is genuinely amazing and you can literally lose yourself in it for hours. The writing is mostly good but at times seems a little bit random, almost computer generated. Obviously it isn't because you see the exact same text repeatedly whenever you re-enter that area or talk to the same person. In that regard it feels like they could have written a few variants for each thing just to increase replay value. As I said, the prospect of redoing it all when I inevitably die doesn't exactly appeal to me.

412140,,"NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit  http://microfloppy.net/2016/03/26/electric-highways/   When there’s a lot of things going on in life and in work I end up playing a lot of shorter games. Luckily Steam has had an abundance of free short games lately so I haven’t had a problem finding things to play.  One game that really surprised me was Electric Highways. It was so surprisingly gorgeous and impressive (made by one developer and one composer) that I had to write a review for it.  You play a VR developer in the not-so-far future (2072) who tests his game for the last time. It is mostly a walking simulator, with some puzzle-like elements that mostly consist of finding the correct path to take.  What impresses me is how well the game fits together. Half of the experience is the soundtrack, consisting of nice, smooth synth tunes. The composer has done an amazing job creating the music to the game. Appearance-wise, the graphics are old-school but still manage to look grand and majestic. And, finally, the gameplay flows nicely without any annoying bugs, slow movement, or strange roadbumps. I had a great gaming session with this game and actually ended up playing the game a total four times in a row while just enjoying the music and the setting. It’s a very serene and calming game with a great atmosphere.   9/10 eyes ",1,0

200710,Torchlight II,"After playing and getting tired of Diablo 3, I thought I'd be too burnt out to play another similar game. Turns out I was wrong and this was a really well made game. It has a nice pet system, identifying of items, and great game play. Spent hours on this. Liked this more than D3  The game is a pretty simple to learn 1-4 player co-op RPG. There are 4 classes -- your usual caster, melee warrior, ranged specialist, and a super tank that can cross as massive pet army class [aka engineer]. The loot system is similar to your usual RPGs and in the later parts of this game, they introduce a lottery unidentified item shop keeper. As far as difficulty goes, the developers did a great job of scaling the monsters between difficulties and levels. There is no reward for playing the game at a higher difficulty, but beating the game in a higher difficulty is in itself rewarding.

391540,Undertale,"This is what gaming is all about. As you can see I have played 10 hours of this game. I got it yesterday, 4 hours yesterday 6 hours today. This is not like me at all, I am a busy guy. Today I did not study for my degree, I did not go for my daily jog, I didn't eat, I just about went to the toilet (eventually). This game is completely magical.   'RPG' is a term which barely means anything anymore, it is so broad that the label 'RPG' is no guarantee you will like a game if you have liked an 'RPG' before. So I will first make some comparisons to other games (though I should first say that in most aspects this is like no game I have ever played before). The two comparisons I would make are to the original Legend of Zelda game and to the Pokemon Game Boy games.   Now I will attempt to tell you what it is about this game that has got me so addicted (the only reason i've stopped now is because i'm on the final boss and i've failed about 6 times). First of all the art style is beautiful, simplistic yet effective, the world you inhabit in this game is strange and wonderful, at first it looks pretty dull and dreary, but there are many different places to explore which have character and individual charm.   Second of all, the characters, this is a contender for this best thing about this game; the characters in this game are some of the best i've encountered. There are some lovely characters, warm, friendly and inviting, with emotional backstories and dark secrets. There are some absolutely hilarious characters who make you laugh out loud with everything they say, many who seem mean spirited at first, but by the end they'll have you smiling and when they call your character their 'friend' you really feel an emotional attachment. There are a few who are malicious, filled with pools of dark desire. I won't give anything away specifically about any of these characters, but to name a few of my favourites to look out for: Toriel, Flowey, Bratty and Catty, Temmie, Sans and Papyrus, Megatton and that kid that follows you around. Some hilarious, some dark (or seemingly so), some sweet (or seemingly so), but all beautifully crafted and developed. You will truly learn to love or loathe them.   This brings me on to the next thing about this game; the humour. This game is genuinely hilarious, this game had me laughing more even than Stick of Truth. The humour is oddball and fast-paced, the dialogue will have you laughing out loud on many occasions. This, along with the character development is what drives the storyline.  The storyline itself is extremely touching, it is one which starts of dark and mysterious and continues in this vein, revealing slightly more of itself as it progresses. Your choices matter in this game and your choices will have you feeling genuine emotions. I felt deep regret and sympathy as well as genuine happiness.   The second contender for the best part of the game is the battle system. This is truly a work of art. I won't give anything away about how it works, but suffice it to say for a turn-based battle system, it is a lot more than simply making a choice and clicking your mouse. It does allow you to make choices, but once these are made the true beauty of the battle begins and you see the craftsmanship that went into this game. The battles can also be extremely funny.   There are a lot of secrets to uncover beneath the main storyline, though I have reached the final boss, I am sure I will replay the game to uncover more of this, there are many mysteries and so many characters to interact with that i'm sure a second playthrough is warranted.   This game is fast becoming one of my favourites, there is nothing negative I can think of to say. It is fiendishly difficult in places, charming, deep, emotional and hilarious.   One last thing: take note of the tagline 'The RPG where you don't have to destroy anyone' remember this, or you may be filled with deep, deep regret.",1,0

289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"This game falls short. I didn't think I'd say this about Civilization VI, but it disappointed me. Before I list off all its flaws, I will mention that this game is beautiful, and the music and atmosphere is stellar - nothing less expected of a Civ game. At its core it's a worthwhile purchase; feel free to comment on any of the points I'm about to make.  1. Barbarians are ridiculous - I have a harder time staving off barbarians than I do taking on two civilizations at once. I think if you spawn near barbarians and they have horses, you should just restart your game. Save yourself the hassle - you'll lose a lot of early game pressure building units to take them out.   2. Victories come as a surprise. Twice now I've won a cultural victory without wanting to. I was wanting a scientific win or domination; ploughing through Rome and China only to see Cultural victory screens. Very disappointing. From now on I'll disable cultural and religious wins.   3. The government slots are so messy once you reach the mid-game. It takes eons to reach the next row of government - Civlilzation V did it better with the talent trees. You're given very limited slots and they're all rather 'meh'. Some are far too powerful not to use, so you're stuck with all this clutter.  4. Religion in this game is absolutely ridiculous. Leaders repeatedly break their promises not to convert your cities mere turns after saying they won't, and if you go to war with them your warmonger penalty remains the same as it would if they had not have broken their promise. Just hope that you have enough faith to birth Inquisitors like you're Spanish.  5. The AI is shocking. I already know the personalities of all the leaders. China will denounce me on turn 1 if it gets a sniff that I want to build a wonder in my life time. Denunciations flow in at the speed of sound if you sneeze the wrong way; Civilization V was so much more freeing and surprising.   In short, playing this offline will be garbage. You'll want to play with your friends if they can afford the price tag. Overall I'd give this a 6/10 - I feel that in the future it will surpass that score and I'll likely review it again when the balances come through, because boy does this game need it.",1,0

266210,One Way Heroics,"=HEADS UP= I had a review before this one about the game being good. This stays of course but i had to clarify some points and fix this old messy review that i made before.  =INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW= 1. My reviews tend to be a bit longer. If that is the case please be patient and read everything. 2. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.] 3. If you want to try to change my opinion with arguments that make no sense in any way then please do not comment at all.  =REVIEW= Now what can i say about this game? That it is worth the money. It is a small game with only one purpose for you. Go forth and kill stuff. But there is a twist to it. The World is ending and you are the legendary hero to venture out and try to get ahead of what is coming after you to kill you. And what is that right behind you? Pure Darkness.  This game leads in a certain direction and that one is Right. You go as far as you can get to meet at the end the Bad guy to stop the End of the World. But that is not an easy task. Even though this game is semi roguelike you wont have that much trouble with it like other roguelike games. Over the time of you playing you will die. But everytime you can transfer items into a little box that is between the dimensions. And as soon as you visit a new world you can decide if you want to take it with you or not. This makes the game a bit more enjoyable and easier for you. But in the end it depends on you how it ends.  The game brings you into a randomly generated world. Here will the Adventure begin and here you can do whatever you want. Go on and kill some bad guys. You are the Hero. Go into the Taverns and buy gear and let the people help you. Or just kill them and their guards. That is right. You are allowed to do everything you want. Kill, destroy and so on and so forth. But there is a nice twist to it. If you are the great Hero you are able to find people that want to help you defeating the bad guy. And since everyone trusts you they will not attack you when seeing you. If you do attack other people though the game will punish you. The word goes around very fast and in other inns or taverns the guards will recognize you for what you did and will try to kill you. But not only the guards will turn aggressive but also the other people.  So it is up to you what will happen in the game. At the very end it is the bad guy who you want to kill. But it depends on you how easy or hard this may be.",1,0

550,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a four player co-op action horror game that comes from Valve. It takes place during a zombie invasion and you and your friends have to fight your way through the hordes of undead in order to reach safety.  You play one of four characters based on known horror stereotypes. The Veteran is a former soldier, now he's old and tired but don't think he lost skills cause of that. The Punk is a biker and a criminal. He's a bad-♥♥♥ that can't really take the situation serious. The Nerd is an unlucky desk jockey that used to spend his days either coding or playing games. Now he has to use his brain and skills to survive. The Expert spent all her time watching zombie flicks, reading zombie books, playing zombie games and discussing zombies online. When the zombie outbreak took place her otherwise useless knowledge made her an expert.  You can play through four different scenarios, called movies, with five maps each where the objective is to reach safety. You have to work together with your friends to find strategies in order for you all to survive. To give you an unique experience it uses your performance to tailor how often you get attacked and the ferocity of them in order for you to be challenged without being overwhelmed.  The game also offers a Versus Mode where you and your friends can compete four-against-four, changing between playing the team of survivors and playing specialized zombie-monsters. The Hunter is a fast and agile type that can jump high and far. You attack by tackling the other opposite team and clawing them to death. The Smoker is a sniper type of monster that uses it's tongue to yank away unsuspected players. The Boomer spews out a substance that attracts others of the enemies position. It's also a human bomb that explodes upon death, injuring everything close. The Charger is basically a berserker. It charges the enemy, killing everything in it's way and flings everyone else around with a heavy blow. The Spitter is a range type that spits acid. The Jockey latches on to the back of the other teams members and takes over.  In Survival Mode you, and your friends of course, are truly tested to see how long you can stand against the hordes of zombies that are thrown at you.",1,0

The voice actors are great and plotline is good, but not great and does feel as though it ends abruptly in such a way to lead into a sequel to wrap things up. The combat and spell crafting are what makes the game rather enjoyable and worth experiencing. Great for someone looking for intense magical combat rather than a deeply immersive role-playing experience.  The combat is straightforward with no resource management (no ammo/mana other than a recharging shield) and relies blocking and teleporting for defense and for offense switching between three Sigils (like elements) each with a single target, a targeted area of effect, and a self radiating nova (from a good block or charged teleport). The basic projectile attack can be crafted with three different shapes, one for the basic shot that has a small amount of auto-aim, one for a lobbed bomb that explodes into smaller bursts for a semi-AoE, and a shorter ranged spraying ray. Similarly the Area power can be crafted into three shapes, a basic AoE, a radiating pool that hits anything that passes into it, and an exploding trap. Each spell is crafted with Augments onto the Shapes that dictate not only bonuses, but also the spell's attunement to either Damage, Control, or Mastery. Damage is self explanatory, and Control is pretty standard hold/paralyze effect, but Mastery is a bit more complex working often as a debuff, but always as a way to build up extra potential critical damage. Hit a target with a control attuned spell to lock it down, then a mastery spell to increase the critical damage, and finally a charged damage spell for 100% critical chance and watch the fireworks. The basic elemental Sigils (Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Kinetic) each influence the shape of the spell in subtle ways to give many options for building together various combos of spells that work well together, and it can be fun (though sometimes a bit daunting) to sort out which of the many permutations work best for you. The more advanced Sigils (Corruption, Delirium, Necromancy, and Phase) start behaving a bit more radically different in how they work. Even your character's shield (this games equivalent for hit points) is craftable with various shapes to help tailor your combat tactics ranging from fewer teleport blinks but more hit points for the tank playstyle to less hit points and unlimited blinks for more active and mobile dodger playstyle.  The crafting loot is one of the places where the game takes after the likes of Diablo, with the loot drops from mobs being these building blocks of Shapes and Augments used to craft spells, with the level of the loot as well as its colored rarity dictating how powerful of a spell you can end up crafting with it. Another is the bad guys can spawn with the occasional affix that grants it some perks like knockdown or faster attacks, radiating damage, or even making fellows invulnerable.",1,0
248390,Craft The World,"[edit] How sweet, they introduced rats in the latest update, and the solution to get rid of rats via paid DLC. Thanks devs, thats a real insentive to keep playing this game :(    After spending a long time playing Minecraft and Terraria, I started looking for a new game with similar playing experience and that would hook me in just like those ones. Craft The World seemed to do just that, and once I started playing I found myself sucked in and spending long hours immersed, at least until I completed the first world.  The game is very enjoyable to play, easy and intuitive to learn. It’s fun to command around your army of cute little dumb dwarfs. And dumb they are, sometimes amusing you with their complete goofiness and sometimes testing your patience to the limit, as they so often seem to refuse collaboration. They have a persistent tendency of being in the wrong place. Command your dwarfs to build something, and you can be sure all other idle dwarfs will run to that same spot and stand there doing nothing, just hampering the dwarf who is actually trying to do the building. Relax your attention for a moment, and the dwarves may wander off getting lost into caves or falling down to their deaths into pits full of critters.  All this fun will last you through the first world though, as you will have to start from scratch once you beat the first world and start the second one. All the long hours you spent grinding through the tech tree, collecting resources, upgrading and training your dwarfs will all be lost once you make it through the portal to the next world.  This is a major drawback of this game, as it gives you little reason to keep on playing after the first world. It’s frustrating to have to start over, and not being able to keep your dwarves and tech upgrades. I don’t mind arriving at a new world to build and explore, but starting everything all over from point zero with one dwarf and no tech was enough for me to put the game down for good.  Another part of the game mechanics that makes little sense is the huge tech tree you have to work through in order to get access to better equipment. Many of the items you are forced to craft in order to advance are completely useless (mirrors, decorative items, columns, statues, gargoyles...). These useless items should not be mandatory.  It would also be nice to be able to assign individual tasks to a dwarf or group of dwarves, as the current game only allows tasks to be assigned collectively. This task assignment is not always efficient – sometimes a dwarf standing right next to a assigned task will do nothing while another dwarf will come from far away to complete that task.  I can say without any doubt that I enjoyed playing this game and that the 30 hours+ spent to finish the first world were worth the money I paid for it, but I wish there had been a way to continue the game without losing everything I conquered.  Maybe the developers will correct these issues in a future update, as it has been a major source of complaint among players.",-1,0

338310,Warden: Melody of the Undergrowth,"This is a half-recomendation.  The game is, at its heart, good, however it less than unpolished, it is downright rough in areas. Some mechanics are difficult to control to the point of irritation and the game will kill you a number of times because of faults with the physics engine whereby you will maintain your momentum when you jump, so if you start sliding off something the traditional method of jumping to get a better foothold won't work. This can also throw off your jumps if you land somewhere that gives you this momentum and jump before realising that you're flying uncontrollably off course.  However, despite those faults, the game IS still playable and I am confident they can be patched and fixed at a later date.  Another qualm is that despite the narrative woes the main character goes through at the beginning of the game he is quite content to smile like a goof throughout a lot of it, making it difficult to get invested in what is going on.  HOWEVER... having said all of that I still recomend the game. There is some very good art direction going on here, and some of the models really impressed me. The gameplay, though rough, is pretty solid and thus-far is about the same level of challenge you would get from Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask.  The developers also seem to be rather proud of the lore they have given to this world, as one of the collectibles in the game are lore scrolls that give brief explainations of the world, and the things you will find in it, and they are kept in a dedicated lore tab. It is not a large gesture but it does a lot to reassure me of how much the devs care about the game.  The game is at its best when nobody is talking and you are let loose to explore an atmospheric area. There is plenty of evocative map design going on here and I will be interested to discover more of it going forwards. I hope the developers keep working on this game post-launch to smooth out the edges (and honestly, those are edges that should have been smoothed before release just fyi, lads).",1,0
391540,Undertale,"I picked up Undertale in the Christmas Steam sale, so I got aboard the Untertale train pretty late. I had managed to avoid spoilers, so I was playing through it blind, but most of the way through my first playthrough of this game, I have to say I thought the game was kind of overhyped.  Sure, the writing was pretty funny at times, and the music was good, and the schtick of an RPG where you could talk your way through everything instead of killing was different. But I didnt get the story, and some of the boss fights were just tedious, to the point where I was pretty close to just quitting instead of continuing to slog through dying over and over and over on the final boss. When I finally got past him to the end of the game, it was with more of a sense of a grand FINALLY! than a grand finale.   But then, without putting spoilers in this review, lets just say that at that point, the pieces of the story that I had been missing finally clicked into place, and my appreciation of the narrative blossomed exponentially.   I no longer think this game is overhyped; in fact, I don't think it has gotten nearly as much attention as it deserves.  Since then, I have played through the entire thing, start to finish, two more times (something I have never wanted to do for any other RPG, at least without a couple years in between, and certainly not back-to-back-to-back playthroughs). Each time, I have gleaned more hidden gems of absolutely marvelous storytelling (there is a metric buttload of secrets all over the place.) The dialog and events are by turns charmingly funny and incredibly, heart-wrenchingly sad; no game has ever made me laugh OR cry as much as this one has. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1,0

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"I don't have a ridiculous amount of hours in this game, but let me tell ya, I don't usually do these reviews unless the game is REALLY special to me, or to warn someone of what they're getting into before dumping cash into a game that isn't worth it.  To be honest as I bought the game my initial thought was the latter. I thought this was just some little game with a sharp learning curve which makes it difficult for most to beat in under an hour. I thought I would see everything in the game in under two hours and I'd be able to return it and get my $15 back to buy a more worthwile game.  Apparently this was not the case....  I'm gonna try to keep this short by simply listing some Pros and Cons:  PROS: - Hard but fair. If you were interested in this game because you want a challenge, this is for you. The gameplay is ALOT deeper than it seems. - Sick and twisted atmosphere. Edmund McMillen officially has the most F***ED UP mind for creating this game.. and i LOVE it. 'Yay Cancer!'? who says that?? - Secrets. If you like secrets, this game gives absolutely NO shortage of secrets. I've played for over 40 hours and I'm nowhere near close to finding everything in the game - Multiple endings. This is in no way a 'story driven' game, but I will say if you think you've beaten the game, KEEP PLAYING. the End Credits only mean you've unlocked MORE of the game, whether it be new power ups, new bosses and enemies, or new level types. There will ALWAYS be something new and you'll never really be done with the game. - Multiple characters with different stats and special perks. - Power ups do more than just 'power you up'. As you play the game and collect powers you're character will become more and more unrecognizable, from hilarious to utterly gross to nightmare-inducing and terrifying.  CONS: - Only problem I truly have about this game, is I wish it gave more info on what the power-ups do. Everything is intentionally vague and i guess it's part of the charm and learning curve of the game, but you can have all of these power-ups equipped at once and won't know what half of them actually do. Alot of them are more obvious than others, but the ones that arent should have a better description.",1,0

There are also many, many possible solutions to every problem, so you can really work things your own way. If you complete a difficult mission and check out other solutions on youtube, you might find there was a way to solve it 5x more efficiently, and it will blow you away. Note that the mechanics rely on loops, so you're essentially programming an assembly line.  Last but not least, the music is great, which is good because you'll be listening to it a lot.",1,0

231740,Knights of Pen and Paper +1,"Knights of Pen and Paper was a IOS and Android game that could rival Angry birds, Candy Crush saga and....Flappy bird??. But since Knights of pen and paper was released on PC it has become even bigger than its compedators, I have hundreds of hours clocked on the IOS version of this game and have loved every single moment of it. The PC Version has increased features, some added monsters, adventures and etc and will keep you playing for hours.  Knights of Pen and Paper is as the title suggests a pen and paper kind of game like Dungeons of dragons, where you roll a dice and depending on the number you can get good or bad results. For example, ingame you are camping in the woods and you have to get between 5 and 10 in order for your group to rest without being attacked, if you get lower than 5 and 20 your group will be attacked by an enemy equal to your Level. When you travel you roll the dice and same as before you will either get good or bad results.   The characters in this game range from a Jock, A Rocker, Teen girl, Alien, Little brother, Grandma, and many more, each character has a different ability that will make you think if thats the right character for a class. Another example would be the Grandma who has extra Threat so if the gradma was a Warrior she would be the Tank of the group being that the monsters will attack her more than any of her group. The Story ingame is completely up to you, you make choices and the characters follow them. Each character type has their own funny quirks and quips like the little brother shouting 'PICK ME PICK ME PICK ME' when going into battle or the Jock character just being an ♥♥♥.  10/10 must Buy ;3",1,0
272060,Serena,"A very awesome, short little point and click adventure in a pychological thriller tale that takes you through the story of a man lost in his own cabin, discovering that his wife is no longer in the cabin, and not recalling any of his previous event's in his life, he desperactly searches clues in the cabin to discover what and where his lost wife had gone too. The story starts off very quickly, as soon as you launch the game, i'm not sure if there are mutiple paths in the game to take, as I had just beaten it a momment ago. This game plays as a classic point and click game, you look around the cabin with a hand icon that will signalfy wether you can interact with any said object or not. when interacting with objects in game you can hear the character you play as recall past memories, or past thoiughts, this is used to help you gain knowledge of his past and present thoughts, I won't go into further detail as it is a short game, but I found it to be very fun and would like to return to this title sometime in the near future.",1,0

Omitted it seems. Worse, the tutorial, which beginners like me must cling to is an unmitigating mess.The instruction sprawl out ot their box and obscure what they are telling you to do.So there are then boxes to try and shift with provinces getting picked up and cluttered in with it.Meanwhile the instructions chug on even though you aren't sure you are in the right country any more let alone which stack to merge.I have a reasonable knowledge of German geography in the 17th century but a lot of the time I wouldn't have a clue where I was supposed to be,or how to do what I was supposed to be doing and the instructions were most likely obscuring it any way..I understand it's complex stuff and some brain is required to get to understand a clever game but the tutorial is a mess and the instructions construed poorly.

Hunted - S vs S based mode with Player Zombies aswell. You spawn in a random location on the map, and your objective is to stay alive the longest. Scavenge the abandoned houses along the way, but beware - hitting B as a human brings up your phone, and you and other players can see who is close aswell as get a buzzing noise when hitting the trigger. If you die you will respawn as a zombie and your only task is to bring down the remaining survivors. Last survivor alive wins the round.  Escape - Band together with friends and strangers in this Survivor vs AI / PC zombies. Your phone will let you know what objective you need to accomplish and your main goal is to escape from the map. Weapons, ammo and items will be found along the way. Make sure you check every corner as they are sometimes hidden or you need to progress further to unlock the areas they are in.  Extraction - Survivor vs AI / PC zombies where your goal is to follow the GPS on your map and find survivors held up in houses. Once you reach a holdout point, vast amounts of zombies will begin spawning, so share your ammo and your weapons with your friends, as each member of your team that gets killed will come back as one of the ravenous corpses coming to eat you. Round ends when all survivor packs have been extracted, or the zombies kill either all Player survivors or NPC survivors in a pack.  Panic (Objective) - The P:O mode was taken from the spiritual prequel Zombie Panic! Source, another game worth picking up as it's free, and features a strictly PS vs PZ combat zone, where the survivors need to complete the objectives much like in Escape.  Panic (Classic) The original game mode from ZP!S which just like the Objective mode features only player combat. Survive the zombie rush.

409390,Marble Mountain,"Marble Mountain is an enjoyable game where a little marble goes on a big adventure. Very much like a spiritual successor to Marble Madness, Marble Mountain focuses on controlling a marble and having it zip through tricky but enjoyable obstacles. The main problem you may come across is that the camera cannot be controlled, but after a while you get used to the quirky auto-movements and are able to make difficult parts with relative ease and enjoyment. And that's really the only qualm I had (among other vastly smaller nitpicks), will you be able to get the marble to it's ultimate destination?  With plenty of levels, appealing visuals, monumental design, and tons of customization for the marble Marble Mountain is a game worth picking up.",1,0

It has lots of puzzles to complete (looks like a good 30ish hours to do them all) and there will probably be more coming later. It has multiple difficulty levels if you're new to this game.

319630,Life is Strange™,"This game heavily relies on atmosphere and character colour/drama, as such you will be treated to many long unskipable cut-scenes with accompanied (mostly acoustic guitar) music. These happen very frequent and give the game a strong film/TV feel. Due to this, your enjoyment of the game will be dictated by your enjoyment of the story elements and interest in the characters. Play episode 1 for free to judge if they match your taste.  My thoughts? Yeah, it's a fairly good P&amp;C game. The rewind mechanic mostly functions as a puzzle solving tool, but one can also use it to change any choice made in-game, thus enabling you to experience all the immediate resulting variations of your choices without requiring multiple playthroughs; but rewind does not show long-term results (if any exist).  The puzzles are very easy and mostly serve as in-game 'speed bumps' to slow progress; in fact many puzzle solutions only become available once you hit a mandatory fail-state, forcing you to use your rewind mechanic. The game designed the choice system well and your decisions have a varying level of impact on the NPC interactions, however don't expect an ability to make story driven choices as there is really only one track of story to follow. Nevertheless the dialog options do add colour to the tale.",1,0

But, I am guessing alot of you were expecting a huge improvement to one of the best franchises in gaming. If that is what you are looking for you are going to be really disappointed.  You can read other reviews to see the particulars of why this game is so underwhelming. It truly feels like a $14.99 DLC as a concept, it feels unfinished. I am really disappointed in this game and I refuse to pay another $30.00 in DLC to get a truly worthwhile game.   This feels like a tactic EA would use, its sad to see this sloppy product from Firaxis.",-1,0

394230,Battleborn,"Because I've invested thousands of hours into the Borderlands franchise (man, that franchise definitely has re-playability) I had really high expectations for this game and it met a lot of them: great graphics, a good variety of playable characters, variety available in the helix tree (or whatever it's called) BUT, I quit playing it after 2 weeks because of several reasons: 1)it sucked having to wait so long to get a team and often, I'd only end up with one, and occasionally 2, other people. 2) it didn't match people by skill level very well 3)It got boring playing the same areas over and over - and over and over. Occasionally the lag from so much going on the screen made it stupidly impossible to fight, especially when WATER was whooshing everywhere! But, the thing that probably annoys me the most is that it's on sale this week for $29.99. I'm not sure I can even see myself playing it again (until some distant future date when I might be bored to death) and because of that, I feel like I threw away nearly 100 bucks, And now they have the balls to charge for fancier skins (that don't add any features) and taunts?!? If they weren't just cosmetic (visually/audibly) it might be worth investing some REAL cash (above and beyond the money I already feel like I threw away), but NO.",-1,0

As this is a game I played since I even obtained my first Compaq 486 computer, I think this is one of the ulterior classic puzzle games and worth picking up if you never played it before.

However, just finishing it (or rather, playing 2/3s of it, tiring of it, and watching the rest), it doesn't live up to my expectations. The story falls flat, only hitting a few interesting notes in the whole 8-hour experience. The gameplay is simplistic and repetitive, and every time a computer screen said 'INSUFFICIENT POWER' or 'PLEASE INSERT 3 THINGS' I'd roll my eyes and go pixel-hunting again.   To the game's credit, the visual and audio design is superb, selling the atmosphere and the scares very well. The world the game builds is an interesting one, albeit lacking in the detail I so badly wanted it to have. I was intrigued, but ultimately let down.  I feel like what's here in this game was maybe half or a third of what I had hoped it would be, stretched out over three times as much actual playtime as it warranted.   I will absolutely be looking out for Frictional's next game, but as for this one, it really didn't live up to my expectation.",-1,1

410110,12 is Better Than 6,"It's a decent game - yes it's a Hotline Miami-a-like. I certainly wouldn't say clone, enough effort has gone in, it's just in the same genre. If you can pick it up cheap I would - it's challenging, but when you die it's your fault not the controls. One downside is that it feels like 'wild west hat simulator' sometimes - you can't tell the difference between a live guy and a dead guy because they both just look like hats.They should proabably change the colour on dead enemies. I'd like an option to zoom out slightly, almost like an FOV slider, without breaking the game. You can press a button but sometimes you'll get killed by a hat that's barely on screen and therefore 12 feet in front of you.  Music is good (not exactly thematic but still) and art style is interesting if nothing else. A little colour wouldn't hurt! As I said it's challenging, I haven't even completed the first act (of 3 I believe) in an hour so I'm happy with the pricing. If there's ever an update then some voice acting would go a long way for immersion too.  I've said a lot negative, but I'd buy it again having played it. If you like HM buy it.",1,0

474820,,"A short, surreal point-and-click game. Even considering its criminally short length, it is frustrating because it's very difficult to discover what you are supposed to do. I was hoping from the images and description that this would be something like Samorost, but to draw such a comparison would be a huge disservice to that game. You explore an area with your mouse cursor, scrolling around clicking stuff and hoping it progresses you somehow. Repeat a few times and the game is over. As I finished it, I couldn't believe what I had completed was not just an introductory level.  The artwork is nice, reminds me of old windows stuff (in a good way) but there really isn't very much of it. If it weren't for the unfathomable 'puzzles' you could complete this in a couple of minutes. I can't believe anyone has got the trading cards for this game without just idling it. Charging money for it is very cheeky, and even for less than a pound it's really not worth it. There are lots of free games on Steam, and you'd do better with almost any one of them.

200710,Torchlight II,"In college I was a huge D2 single player fan. Loved it, and was looking for a similar type of experience. Was really excited for D3 and grinded for 70+ hours to not even get to hell when it first came out and was furious that couldn't use any of the drops amd having to buy gear on Auction House ever other level (gun to head) and just didn't really find the experience enjoyable(cut scenes were cool). Torchlight was on sale and bought it with low expectations to be honest. 20$ instead of 60$ for D3.  Loved it, played it all the way through on two charectors and really enjoyed the experience and the WOW factor of what gear is going to drop next. It truly felt like the next step after D2. Played for 67 hours (i thought more....). I actually really enjoyed the artistic difference in this game. Its less dark and more happy kill evil monsters looking. Felt fun and enjoyable all the way through never really felt like grinding.  Only Con- End game doesn't really exist, its a play through and basically be done.  Hope this helps and hope you enjoy the game. Andy",1,0

It seemed to turn Lara Croft into everything else- just killing everytone, but then I decided to get it. IT WAS WORTH IT! Great story line! Playing through some of the parts I even found myself saying 'This feels like I'm playing the other Tomb Raider games'. Its fast paced, you will get stuck (and get fustrated).

The only shortcoming whatsoever in this installment of the Elder Scrolls series, is the hit-miss ratio battle system, which can easily be fixed with a simple command code, the only one you should ever use if you wish to fully enjoy this masterpiece if a game.",1,0

231430,Company of Heroes 2,"Finally! we have a sequel to the critically accalamed Company of Heroes Series. The first games received many awards and was dubbed the best RTS of all time. From what I have played, Company of Heroes 2 feels and looks like it is a fitting sequel. The team at Relic Studios has done it again, from beautiful graphics, how they implemented the 'True Sight' system fog of war, your infantry squads being able to climb over fences, stone walls and many other types of cover, the meticulous use of the need for a good strategy and the use of the weather, like blizzerds, snow on the ground to slow troop movements and the need to keep your troops from freezing. The game focuses on the Easter Front of World War 2, you can play as the hard hitting and gritty Russians and their infamous penal battalions, or the strategic and cunning Germans with their dangerous Panzer tanks. Over all I give this game an 8 1/2 out of 10. Congratulations to Relic on producing another great game!",1,0

221830,The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles,The first game was fun. But this game is just that same joke all over again and it is extremely boring. The first game had polished cutscenes but this one doesn't. The voice acting is really annoying .The voices are also very loud while the background score is almost non-existant. The worst part is the terrible logic for solving the puzzles. It is just crazy the amount of pixel/object hunting and object combining permutations you have to do to solve a puzzle. An overall boring and frustrating experience. The selling point of the first game was it's wacky humor and that has dried up and this is just a grind. If you still want some cheap laughs and want to know how the prequel story that led to Nate and Critter teaming up then just play with a walkthrough. That's what I did right after chapter 2.,-1,0

255370,KickBeat Steam Edition,"This is just a ton of fun, and I don't know how I had never heard of it. KickBeat is a DDR-style rhythm game with a holistic sensibility about the beat, jumping among drums, guitar, and vocals as they become prominent in the song. It doesn't feel like you're playing the drums with your keyboard; it feels like you're conducting the whole song. The mapping of the built-in songs is precise and joyful. The songs themselves are way more industrial-metal than I usually prefer, but in this game they work perfectly, and you'll agree with me even if it's not your genre.  Apart from gameplay, one thing that really stands out is the unexpectedly hilarious writing of the cutscenes. Honest belly laughs. It's baffling how writers with such good instincts could name their game KickBeat, possibly the most forgettable name for a video game I can think of, right up there with the equally underappreciated Defender's Quest.  The upper difficulty levels sometimes require three simultaneous button presses, and some keyboards -- including both of mine -- have an issue with 'ghosting' that prevents them from registering all three. This is not a game bug, it's a hardware bug, but it's still something to be aware of before you buy. The lower difficulty levels are still plenty satisfying and offer lots of replayability.  Full-throated recommendation. This game deserved press and didn't get it.",1,0

270170,Depression Quest,"Depression Quest is a well written interactive text game. An unnamed male protagionist, whom you play as, suffers from depression. He finds it hard to muster up the motivation to do anything and hates himself for it. There are many nights where he can't fall asleep because of the insecurities that plauge his mind.  This is also represented very well with the filter that is put on the photography that acompanies the text. There is text at the bottom on most pages that helps monitor how severe the character's state of depression is. The player has multiple opertunities to chose different kinds of treatment or to ignore it all together.  The protagionist has multiple friends and how you choose to socalize with them affect the ending and the character's overall mood. The parts with the protagionist's girlfriend, Alex, got to me the most.  Most of my closest childhood friends suffer from depression and it really hit home for me to play this story out. When people think of depression, they think of sadness. What people really feel is exhaustion and a lack of motivation accompanied by self hatred for this lack of energy. This is one of the points Depression Quest drives home the most.  Even if it doesn't sound interesting, I never felt uninterested. It took me an hour and a half to complete it the first time and even in parts where I thought it was hard to continue, that I wanted to put the game down, it was never in disinterest. This game is beautiful and I would encourage anyone who likes interactive text to give this one a chance. It is, afterall, free.  I just hope this scandle allows this game to reach more people because of it...",1,1

2600,Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,"Pros:  1. This game has tons of options for character cutomization. Different vampire clans, each with their own advantages/disadvantages make each playthrough unique. 2. Many different dialogue options. Conversations with characters can go different ways depending on what you choose. 3. Interesting and engaging storyline.  Cons: 1. Know that this game has MANY bugs. It took me multiple tries to get it to work. First, there was an issue with space, then its display settings had to be changed, then it couldn't connect to steam etc etc. It's a pain and takes a while to work them all out, but so many people experience it that you can find the solution easily. 2. The character outfits are sort of glitchy. I doubt this will bother some but I noticed it with certain clothing options. 3. I didn't really care for the more action-oriented aspects of the game. I ended up just trying to get through combat areas quickly so I could get back to the story.  This game is a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend it. However, you have to be willing to go through the process of weeding out the bugs. Like I said, there are a lot of them, but the game is worth it.",1,0

And a final challenge mission as a reward for sitting out the campaign. The gamplay is smooth and very easy to get aquainted with. As with all CoD games it all about Multiplayer. The online experience provided on this game is still very high, servers are active and there are always modded alternatives to vanilla servers. Wide selection of guns and relatively balanced perks.  In my opinion all games in the CoD franchise have been vastly inferior and have been progressively getting worse since Activision realised how big of a success this game was. At is current price even without discounts it's definitely worth the money and time to play.",1,0

Additionally, the background is desolate with pretty much everything trying to kill you.   But there's something about the shear immersion of the game that makes it enjoyable to play. Maybe it's just walking through the nuclear wasteland and meeting the post apocalyptic dark world and it's inhabitants. Or modifying, maintaining, and finding a colossal arsenal of weapons and clothing. Or just plain killing everything and everyone... I have no idea.  I can play this game hours on end and there is easily 100+ hours of game play (not counting DLC or its replay-ability).

245730,Flashback,"Aaahh, a game from the dark ages, where 640kb was more than enough RAM, the CPU ran at 25(50) or 33(66) MHz depending on whether the turbo button was activated or not  and the graphics had 256 different colours.  This game also reminds me about the fabolus music score, originaly tracked in MOD by Audiomonster (aka Raphaël Gesqua)  Flashback was originaly an old dos game, published in 1992 by Delphine Soft./US Gold. But VectorCell made a remake of it in 2013 (published by UbiSoft)   So, the main genre of this old game is action. If anyone mentions the term  2D platformer from the 90's, to me immediately come to mind the following  three titles: Prince of Persia, Another World and Flashback.  The game is situated into the 22nd century, when a scientist Conrad B. Hart,  finds strange machinations with human DNA in a IEG (former United Nations) -  a company that rules the whole world. Each power is based on a herd of docile  sheep that go to where it should be and whoever falls outside of this instrument  becomes a little uncomfortable and the problem affected even our otherwise very  sympathetic scientist, who is also the hero of this game. To fight with enemies you  use your gun, but you can also use objects from the environment, such as stones,  which you can use to hurt your enemies.  All in all, great game, great remake, great timewaster (as all games), but i might be  a bit over nostalgic about this game (it was my youth) ",1,0

I would describe the gameplay as a unique twist on sudoku, making it a bit more maths-y. The maths, however, is so basic and instantaneous in the mind of any average person that it makes for fun and addictive puzzle-solving gameplay!

CONGRATULATIONS have some more legendary loot!! You've been playing for hours and feeling like not getting enough loot? Here! have some more legendaries! In PoE, Alright you maggots! here are some basic rules and take this piece of crap and get killing. GO! GO! GO! 1st boss kill huh? WELL WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FOR, DO I LOOK LIKE A FRIGGIN' CHARITY TO YOU? Get your ♥♥♥ to the next stage GO! GO! GO! What's that? you've been playing for hours and nothing good? BOO F!@KING HOO! You want uniques? You gotta grind like a cheap hooker and work like a kid in a chinese sweatshop   I guess what I'm saying is, in D3, there are lots of hand holding, nurtring and caring.

237930,Transistor,"Rating: 8/10  Transistor has one of the most unique combat systems of any game I've played. It is both a combination of real time action combined with turned based strategy. What makes this interesting is that you can activate turned based combat at any time, but it comes at a big cost. After you execute a 'turn', it is put on a cooldown where most (or all) of your abilities become unavailable for a short time. This makes you very vulnerable to the enemy and creates a very interesting risk/reward type combat system. Do you fight in realtime and suffer from slow attack swings? Or do you take a 'turn' getting off those attacks for free, but suffer a large and vulnerable downtime?  Additionally, any ability can be 'equipped' to any other ability to modify how it works. Your fast bolt attack can be 'equipped' to another attack to make it shoot faster for instance. This gives so many unique combinations of attacks that it's quite overwhelming at first. This dynamic setting of attacks is really rewarding as it feels like your attacks are unique to you. And it allows for a vast amount of different playstyles which keeps combat fresh. You can switch from a heavy hitting melee to a long range mage to a stealthy backstabbing rogue.  But that's not all Transistor has to offer. The backgrounds are beautiful, the voice acting is great, the atmosphere is amazing, the artstyle is sublime, and the story really brings it all together. The mystery of it all keeps you craving for more to make it a true beautiful work of art.",1,0

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"I've only progressed through about 5 of the main story missions.   It's a fun game, confusing if you are unfamiliar with the MGS series.   This timeline   [metalgeartimeline.com]  is a nice read for getting the jist of the story line.   The gameplay is fun, its interesting using your recovery system to shoot people into the sky. I often mess up the controls and end up killing instead of incapacitating the AI which seems to give up searching for a player faster than most stealth games.   As many have mentioned, you can: Go sneaky beaky like, or Go in guns blazing and killing everyone and their mother because you messed up at that one part and broke your silencer on the first shot and now you've gotta kill the guard.   The environments, specifically the rest of the map other than the outposts and bases is, for me, a little bit depressing. It's a desert, sure. There's probably not a whole hell of a lot in there, but there is no reason for you to get on your horse and ride to another side OP or a main mission. I often find myself just calling in a helo and getting extracted so I can redeploy closer to my mission of choice.  One thing I stumbled across is a means of fast travels. Large storage platforms are spread out in the various outposts and you can collect their schedules (forgot the word they use in game, itinerary?). using your box, you can fast travel to other outposts but you need the schedule of the outpost you wish to travel to.   A lot of the story comes from the tapes that you can listen to, now as I've said, there is little reason to run across the map to your next objective, unless you want to listen to the tapes. As soon as you interrupt a tape's play through, you have begin again.   The graphics are truly breath taking and the game has whacky and zany ♥♥♥♥ like all the other MGS games. Emmerich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ his pants, weird as super natural powered enemies and jiggle physics ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).  The customization is fun, considering the lack of it from previous games. It's not up there with the likes of Battlefield or other similar games where you can change the handle, site and barrel of the weapon. But its still cool to have.  All in all, i'd give it a solid 8/10. It's a good game, a great game in fact, but its far from perfect for each and every person out there.",1,0

339350,Choice of Robots,"Don't get fooled by the play time not by the simplicity of the game, I've played this game over and over. And I am awestruck...  I sort of ceased being entertained by games, I found them often to be too simple, too basic, but Choice of Robots did something I have not been prepared for. When I launched the game I was expecting a whimsical futuristic tale, instead I was tossed into an emotional shredding machine, by the time I was done with the game I... cannot explain this. For the first time in my life I understood what it means to love you child, and by god did I love mine. It combines the power of the book with the interactivity of a game to absorb you into the story, you will find yourself pensive about the deeper intricities of the game, I sure as hell am not the same person I was before.   It won't sate everybody however, unfortunately, but those who can appreciate books and futuristic tales will find riveting. Now I need to excuse myself while I cry myself to sleep.",1,0
470260,Event[0],"The game is quite interesting and the old 80's style computers actually bring me back to the tandy PC and macintosh I used as a kid. (Yes, I know, im old. I have probably forgotten more about computers then most of you will ever know). In many ways I love the game, and interacting with Kaizen the computer is a concept I have always found interesting. In other ways the computer is just a program in which you see a programers holy grail as you notices small bits of humanity in it. Then again, is it.  (Caution, I am not trying to give away to much but some information past this point could be a spoiler)   The game itself is nothing more then a solution finder with a few brief moments of action to beat the oxygen clock. Half the game is looking around for clues and the other half talking to Kaizen trying to convince it for hints or information. The game itself is quickly played and the gameplay for all endings changes little until the end. You can play threw near the end then just create a save point to return to just to see all the different endings to have to avoid playing threw what you have already done again.  I recomend this game as a good quick puzzle when its on sale. It is a good concept and opens the question to how much control should an AI be given in real life and how will people actually use it to keep control of others. It brings back fond memories and even has hints of HAL from yes that old movie. The downside of this game is its quickly over to soon. The puzzles, though some could be difficult is not much of a match and the solutions to many things is litteraly written on the walls. The plot is put together by remembering what little you can find of the old crew members from articles left behind and logs which you must carefuly put together yourself. And the ending is simply what you say and do at the end. Though there is several endings, it seems repetitive to play through the game again to see each ending, but then again, the game is short.  For me, this was less of a game and more of a interactive movie. I wish it had more to its plot, was longer to play through and had more on the characters. Maybe with time more will be added. I recomend this game to those who like a good puzzle and pays attention to details, but just like a movie, once its over, you know it. Not much point to do it again for a while. I would recommend it but be picky on your expectations with this one.",1,0

353560,Plug & Play,"Plug &amp; Play is delightfully bizarre in ways that are as unsettling as they are endearing.  The playfulness of the vignettes that seem so mix matched and nonsensical trace intimate analogies into a collage of weirdness. It’s pulling from the darkest areas of failed relationships - denied feelings, refusal to communicate, meaningless sex to avoid complicated questions - but in ways that feel hopeful more than pessimistic. Plug &amp; Play isn’t about something falling apart, but learning to pick yourself up when things don’t work out.  I don’t know that I’d consider it especially adept or subtle in how it goes about this, but its sincere commitment to say something important while painting an amusingly offbeat, sex obsessed world is consistently entertaining and surprisingly considered. It might look like madness from the outside, and it is to a point, but it’s madness with a purpose but which also doesn’t get so caught up in showing how much life can suck that it forgets it can also be pretty fun sometimes.

If you are playing with a friend local co-op mode, I highly recommend playing the game in hard difficulty mode (we played the first 90% in medium then switched to hard in the last 10% - so much better in hard!). Guaranteed laughters. (e.g. accidentally falling off the edge and doing silly things :)  Overall, 10/10 for the lightweight and entertaining gameplay elements.

256290,Child of Light,"My review for Child of Light:  First of all, I'm going to address 2 concerns that I found in Steam community hub: 1. Uplay Those who're going to buy this game should know that this game is going to use Uplay, Ubisoft own game client. I noticed that many people dislike Uplay for certain reason so gonna respect that. I have my own issue with Uplay as well. So if you want to buy this game, make sure you know what you're getting into.  2. Day 1 DLC When the game is released, the dev put several DLCs immediately, including Golem DLC and Dark Aurora DLC which is the Special Edition bonus DLCs, Light Aurora DLC which is the preorder bonus and several 'cheat' DLC which you can buy extra oculis for your game. Golem DLC gives you a new party member and a small quest to get him, while Light Aurora and Dark Aurora DLC give you skins for Aurora and extra oculis and bonus stats. The 'cheat' DLC is actually consists of oculis, which means you can buy the oculis using real money once. Among these DLCs, only Golem DLC adds a bit of content while the skins just for eye candy. As much as I hate day 1 DLC, if you want to support the dev, buy the Golem and the skins DLC only. Of course you can ignore the DLCs if you don't want to support day 1 DLCs. I myself didn't bought any of the DLCs except Light Aurora since I preorder it.  In this game, you're playing as Aurora, a princess who died and reborn into Kingdom of Lemuria. Story progress smoothly, gaining allies and some plot twist. However, the ending is kinda not to say lame, acceptable but not much impact. There are no voice narration for this game except the narrator herself. Somehow, I wish that each character got their own voices to add more personalities to the characters. You can quite rush the game since the story is quite short. And you can restart again with New Game+ feature so you can start the game with OP Aurora.  The artstyle and graphic is beautiful. When you move Aurora around, you can see her hair move depends on the directions. The backgrounds and landscape are nicely drawn. Character animation during combat is kinda static. And the graphic glitch for Aurora’s hair where she transform into a tomboy during battle is not favorable by many, though I can deal with that.   Now lets talk about combat. It's 2v3 style, where you can bring 2 members in your party to fight 1 to 3 monsters at a time. but you can only change party members during combat and not outside which is annoying. At least let the player decide which member goes on combat first. Before combat, you can only manage on the oculis to be equipped on each party members and use any skill points or healing items. In combat, there will be a timeline. Each member and monsters will be on the timeline. When you reach the casting point, you can give order to the said member ie attack, use item or switch party member. After selecting the action, there will be another timeline for casting. If you're attacked during this time, your attack will be cancelled and you'll be pushed back on the timeline which is also known as interrupt. You can also use this to your advantage to prevent monsters from attacking you. There are no visible health bar for enemies and no bestiary to see the weakness of each enemies so you have to discover it yourself, although some of them are kinda easy to spot. During combat, you can also control Igniculus, which is very useful in combat. he can highlight enemies and show it on the timeline. He can also slow down enemies by blinding them, making their progress on the timeline slower for more tactical approach. He can also heal you. To recharge his energy meter, he can either use potion or just shake the light source and collect the light.  There is oculi crafting in this game, which is combining gems to make different and stronger oculis. Only 3 recipes are showed in the game, others you have to discover yourself (we got internet though ;D). Each oculi type has different effect depending on where you equip it. There are 8 types of oculis; 6 can be found in chests and defeating monsters, the other 2 need to be crafted. There is only 1 secret recipe for a special gem, but other than that, just normal crafting stuff. I wish they had put more depth to the crafting part since it's the essential part in the game.  Each character has their own skill tree. Each skill tree got 3 branches and you can focus on either 1 branch first or balancing between each branch. Each branch focus on 1 special skill for the character. Example for Aurora, she got Slash (physical attack), Light Beam (magic, light damage) and Super Light Beam (magic, light damage, can 1 hit KO) (Disclaimer: The skill name is not correct :P). Each skill will have single targeting or multiple. And no character has similar skills, so it's good to know which one you wanna use during combat. Unfortunately, there's no explanation about the skills during combat, which make it hard for players to choose skills. There's also passive skills available, like Counter-Attack, Counter-Heal etc and it helps very much during combat.  The soundtrack, is a masterpiece. I enjoyed every one of the songs. When I first started the game, I was stuck at the main menu because the song at the time, which is Aurora's Theme is mesmerizing. Even the songs during normal battle and boss fight is good and make me more enthusiastic to play. You can buy the digital album from here or you can listen to it on Spotify. Give it a go, I'm sure you'll like it.  Overall, for the $14.99 price tag, it's totally worth the price. I still need to highlight that this game is not for Uplay haters and Steam elitists, because this game use Uplay as DRM so buying for Steam means using 2 DRMs at a time which is not acceptable for some people (you can see it in the community hub, people still b*tching about it lol). And Uplay is still in growing stage and need much more improvement. Other than that, this game is good and I totally recommend this game especially to RPG fans. ",1,1

It really is quite a gem and I recommend anyone with a few hours to kill and a desire to see a beautiful game from the aesthetic to the storyline to pick it up.

I'd recommend this game to people who wished NT had a smoother framerate and / or wanted more weapons.",1,0

225300,Tomb Raider II,"I will resume this game in one word, punishing. So i will break this down easily, when you are making a game, you must adjust the difficulty according to the gameplay mechanics avalibable. The game is clrearly much more hard than the first one (which is nice) but the problem is its badly directed the way they want you to go across all the things. Lets say that if this game has the mechanics and flexibility the TR of the 2000's, it would be an awesome game with just about the right difficulty to keep it chalenging while still punishing you for the mistakes you make. I'm also aware the game has almost 20 years old, but man I grow playing this old games and believe me when I say that it was a common mistake the idea of implementing extreme difficulty with low and unflexible mechanics in games, you may say: 'that is the whole idea' if that so, then why with the advance in tecnology we have, the games are getting more easy? 2 reasons, as the time passes by the mechanics become more natural, the characters are more easy to control and they do less award things and are A LOT more responsive at any command you throw them and the second is marketing (for the sake of hitting the most amount of audiencie possible so everyone can enjoy, therefor much more money).  Now putting aside the unflexible gameplay, the game is pretty solid, havent played enough to talk about the history but seems 'OK', the level desing is pretty awesome and is really well desing to hide the secrets (except for a part on the first level where there is like 2 pickups that require EXTREME coordination (not impossible though) that is more a flaw in the engine where if you are nearby an item lara won't walk to it and interact with it (like underwater) you must step right up and then you can pick it up and this is really annoying because this 2 pickups are in a context where if you aren't fast enough you die and if you pick them up you must pay with a little blood (usually more than 15% of your health, but if you were fast you could make it in one piece but is really hardly likely to happen.), the sound effects has changed a little since the last game and are fairly better, graphics are a bit better (mostly lara's model because now she has her pony tale and it also moves when she runs and if you are in an outside level and idle, the hair will simulate the breeze of wind) and texture overall are at the same quality as the last one, and for the year this game was released they were amazing. Menu still uses the same base, now the compass (which was useless as I never use it) is gone and replaced with a chronometer which give you stats on your game so far, from time taken, secrets founds (which are now 3 little statues per level), and ammo/health packs used, so a pretty nice progress. Also nice progress on the video department, the game doesnt require a DOS OP/DOSbox because windwos 95/98 where already a thing for most PC at the time, plus now in the first start of the game now displays a menu so you can configure it, and the best thing is the res of the game it adapts according to your video card (basically you can run the game on +720p without any problem nor needing to installing nothing).   -Some annoying bugs: -if the 'roof' is a bit close to you, you cant perform a jump at all, and this didnt happen with his successor -If you have custom controls, whenever you relaunch the game, it will use both (your bindings and the default ones, just like the first game) so you need to go to controls in the menu and reselect (everytime you wanna play) 'user controls', otherwise if you bind the space bar with jump you will jump but you also grab your guns.  TL;DR: the game is too punishing for the unflexiblie gameplay/mechanics it has, also the desingners could have done a better job (like as they allowed you to roll in the air and underwater) with some minor details like the way you need to be near an item to pick it up or interact with it on land, grab some of the edges with a less level of exigency and climbing a LOT faster. If you dont mind that things go ahead and play it, otherwise, skip yourself a possible butthurt",-1,0

237740,Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures,"There is a hidden genre of game known only among the hardcore: 'platform hell.' Among its top echelon is the classic, 'I Wanna Be The Guy,' which inspired Steam games Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV. Platform Hell games are identified by one simple trait: the game knows what you are about to do, and punishes you for doing something predictable. A cloud mighdisappear as you land on it, for example, or an apple may fall off a tree UPWARDS as you attempt to jump over it.  As a cataloguer of terrible video game tropes, it is natural that the Angry Video Game Nerds includes many, many, surprises in this game. However, AVGN-Adventures is nowhere near as difficult as these other platformers and is slightly less fun.    The Good:    * Awesome level variety harkening back to several classic video games.  * Dozens of allusions, cameos, and references to Angry Video Game Nerd episodes, classic video games, and video game tropes.  * Your character's light-gun changes color depending on the difficulty level. Pink for easy, orange for normal, and gray for 'old school.' (I was never able to reach one of the higher, unlockable difficulty levels).  * Like Nintendo games of yore, there are plenty of secrets to find.  * Great use of humor.  * Each level ends with a unique boss from nerd-culture.  * Fantastic pause music.    The Bad:    * The levels are a bit short, although they make up it with their difficulty.  * The 'You've got Skill' Steam achievement is duplicated... there are two of them for some reason.  * Control Issue: It is hard to fire your gun to the right if you recently started moving left, and vice-versa. This becomes very annoying.  * Some enemies, like the reindeer on the snow level, have 'magnetism' or something and stay right ON your sprite. since your gun can only fire outwards, it makes them lethal and unfair to fight.  * The game uses the enter key as a pause button, but if you shift+tab out of the game to talk to someone, anytime you hit enter to send your message, the game pauses/unpauses.  * The only level that is truly 'really difficult' is the last one, which is only unlockable after completing all other levels.     The Ugly:    * At times, the game felt more like a chore than a game. I got bored after playing through the first level, but only stuck it out to write this review.  * The game only has a few special items: useless rocks, super scope, 'glitch man,' and 'mecha Jesus.' (I'm making up my own names for these things, I forgot what they're killed.) I was expecting to discover more items as the game continued, but no, there are just the four of them.     The Verdict:    * Pick this up if you like AVGN or platformers, but don't expect a rock-solid experience. I personally did not enjoy my time with it.",-1,0
