Gameplay: Each puzzle helps you progress in the game. Solving the puzzle earns you currency which you can use to play more difficult levels. The more expensive the level, the bigger chance in unlocking one of the reward renders! The last difficulty level has a 100% chance for unlock. You need to choose your own strategy how to unlock all images and how to manage your currency. You can also spend your money in the shop, where you can unlock furry girls as companions or backgrounds. The puzzle is a variant on classic minesweeper, where you need to find all the hidden mines in the board. If you click on the mine, you lose the level without earning any money. If you click on a tile, you uncover a number which tells you how many mines are in the neighbourhood of that tile. The first few clicks are 'safe' preventing you from randomly losing when the board hasn't been uncovered yet. You can right click on an empty tile to mark it as mine and if you are correct, it can help you to uncover the board quicker, as left clicking on an uncovered block will safely uncover all its neighbours if the appropriate number has been marked. For example, left-clicking on a 1 will uncover all neighbours when exactly one of them has been marked.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2279560/header.jpg?t=1676937875,,,cutepengames@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,Contains images of sexually explicit content and nudity.

Often outnumbered, what does a police officer feel like during the conflict? RIOT – Civil Unrest presents the player with the opportunity to experience both sides of the fight - a fight in which there really are no winners. Who is right and who is wrong? Experience RIOT – Civil Unrest and draw your own conclusions. Play as the Police Employ numerous crowd-control tactics, both passive and aggressive. Command Assault, Tactical, and Ballistic squads. Call in police trucks, water cannon or even a tank! Choose whether to use smoke grenades, rubber and plastic bullets or even live ammunition.

After growing tired of everlasting life and having grown older than time itself, the gods built a gigantic monolithic machine. This titan of a device was to take on their endless burden of soul sorting and allow them to die. This 'Hellscreen' machine was soon constructed. But there was no rejoicing, only relief. In a flash, the old gods were gone, lost to time. After millennia of sorting countless souls, the machine begins to malfunction and displaces you. You are taken from the real world at the point of your death and deposited in the Hellscreen realm, instead of the peaceful afterlife you deserve. You are given an inhuman form and are called upon to destroy the machine and its infernal biome. It must be stopped from dismantling the fabric of all existence and destroying all reality and only you can stop it and reset order. Once this is done then perhaps you can return to your eternal resting spot.

Unlike other Three Kingdoms RPGs, the game does not start with the usual storyline, but instead begins with the murder of Liu's mother by the Yellow Turban Rebellion, setting Liu on a path of revenge. Along the way, he meets like-minded individuals such as Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, and together they pledge to save the people in a world of chaos under the peach blossom oath. The game has a total of thirteen main chapters, with a fourteenth chapter added in the third playthrough. Each chapter is based on historical events, and there are also numerous side quests that add to the game's depth.

It makes use of techniques such as binaural beats, subtle strobing, form constants, and includes a body scan meditation, a dream induction, and a soundtrack developed by a healer with experience leading traditionally inspired ceremonies. The experiences in Visitations allow users to turn inwards and explore their own stories and mental states. The spaces are open vessels waiting to be filled by the conscious intentions of the users. Ancient shamans intuitively understood the power of the mind, and that their performances would conjure the body’s innate ability to heal. Modern medicine accomplishes a similar effect with lab coats and pills. Visitations employs technology to similar ends. Development Visitations has been designed from the ground up for use with stand-alone VR headsets like the Go, Quest and even phone based VR which greatly improves accessibility and ease of use. The scenes run in real-time and are procedurally generated. They never loop and are always different allowing them to be an effective object of meditation. Art is Therapy Ancient shamans intuitively understood the power of the mind, and that their performances would conjure the body’s innate ability to heal. Modern medicine accomplishes a similar effect with lab coats and pills. We are beginning to understand that technology can be employed to similar ends. The Spirit of Experimentation We are at the start of a long journey. Visitations is a place for artists and scientists to collaborate on experiments which will lead to a vocabulary and a set of best practices to achieving a variety of different therapeutic and aesthetic goals. Techniques Subtle Strobing Lights - have been shown to directly affect brainwaves, inducing dissociative states, even helping prevent Alzheimer’s. Binaural and Isochronic Beats - have a similar ‘brainwave entraining’ effect as strobing lights and have been used for decades in meditation practices. Form Constants - are geometric patterns which appear during altered states such as hypnogogia and hallucinations. Tunnels - draw the eye to a single point in the distance. Body Scan - is a common meditation practice, employed in Vipassana meditation and others.

In order to participate in the game competition, let's make a game with the theme of Game Theory. Originally thought so, but due to various complicated reasons. In the end it became a spoof game. Because the game operation method is very intuitive and simple, I won’t introduce it here. The game contains a total of six non-zero sum games: 1. Guess the mean 2/3 Enter a number from 0 to 100 .The one who enters the number closest to the average 2/3 of all people’s numbers will get 1,000 coins. 2. Dollar auction Enter a price of 0~1000 to bid for some coins. The person who bid the highest price wins the bid, but everyone has to pay their bid. 3. Traveler's dilemma Enter a number from 0 to 2,000 coins. The one who enters the smallest number will get the same amount of money. 4. Prisoner's dilemma All members cooperate, all get 1,000 coins, one betray, traitors get 500 coins, plural betray, all lose 500 coins. 5. Free rider problem Choose ignore or resist, ignore loss of 300 coins, resist loss of 1,000 coin and terminate the round. 6. Ultimatum Game Enter 0~500 twice to decide how much money distributed to others. If someone refuses to distribute, you will lose 1,000 coins. The game will revolve around the above game. The accumulated star coins or snow coins can be used to upgrade characters. Each character can have different effects according to the level. Only by fulfilling the conditions of the level can you advance the plot, so you need to adopt a strategy that can meet the conditions of the level without losing too many star coins and snow coins. Some levels require the character to reach a certain level to pass the level, so when you are stuck in a level, you can replay the previous level and accumulate star coins to upgrade your character.","['English', 'Traditional Chinese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1760160/header.jpg?t=1640497330,https://asd414831.wixsite.com/theory/,https://www.facebook.com/%E8%81%96%E8%AA%95%E7%AF%80%E4%BE%86%E8%B3%BD%E5%B1%80%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96%E5%90%A7-102280698499166,asd414831@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,7,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,"不重要,tan90,番茄紅貓,EDPH,ChaosXuX",不重要,Single-player,"Casual,Indie,Strategy","Interactive Fiction,Education,Turn-Based Strategy,Cute,Casual,Funny,Strategy,Colorful,Cartoony,Memes,Anime,Linear,Indie,Fantasy,Singleplayer,2D Platformer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1760160/ss_136fbbe6c04f06f9c6d2361b463f0fb35dcef164.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640497330,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1760160/ss_96083aaf72bfa64c2049b0258f4c3e3d3b970705.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640497330,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1760160/ss_e16867675e42c1f97ea0871d1be9af2a1cd12e0e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640497330,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1760160/ss_31caa8c64813d13cf246f9f2356de1bea2e739ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640497330,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1760160/ss_23460c0ff06cea713eaea1e814f1baea0cc7c9c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640497330,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1760160/ss_328557ff7495a02ec3492d15293248fd72dda0e9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640497330",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256852178/movie_max.mp4?t=1632278519

EACH LEAGUE HAS ITS OWN RULES Each league has its own rules and these have been faithfully reproduced in Pro Basketball Manager 2016. Your bosses fix your seasonal goals, which you can even set higher! The recruitment process applied to your team will differ completely according to the league in which you play. If you run a non-professional team, in which the players are not paid, you must convince players to join your side by showing real interest in them. Whereas in the North American league, you will have to handle all the complexity of contracts, exceptions to avoid paying the luxury tax, not to mention trades or the draft. Finally, in the other leagues you will have to manage the buying of players, loans or free agents, taking care not to exceed the payroll allocated to your team for the season.

Pro Basketball Manager 2016 allows you to greatly deepen your experience as a coach by letting you create your own plays, which you can then use live during matches. Set your imagination free, it's you the play master! If you are taking your first steps as a manager, you can also get help from an assistant who will handle the most complex tasks for you. NUMEROUS INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PLAYERS AND COACH Each player has his own personality and his own affinities with such and such a player or club. This will influence his desires and his mood and, as manager, you must find a happy medium. THOUSANDS OF STATISTICS AT YOUR DISPOSAL! Be it individual players or teams, you have a whole range of statistics at your finger tips that allow you to manage your progress. You can thus check on the mental or physical state of your players, evaluate your own career, or even look back through the archives on each match, both for your team or another. A comparison tool even allows you to instantly compare two players. A CUSTOMIZABLE INTERFACE The game interface reflects your team and adopts its colors!

1073790,The Astrolarix,"May 16, 2019",0 - 20000,0,0,2.99,0,1,"The Astrolarix is a solitary starship that navigates in the vacuum of space, you must survive at all costs, gather resources, face adversity avoiding the dangers and overcome the obstacles to progress in the story. This is an isometric adventure with survival elements: Water, food, oxygen and HP. Keeping optimum levels at all costs is a priority if you want to get out safe. Search for containers as well as the different devices on the ship to get supply and useful items. Finding the route in the darkness will not be a problem if you have a good sense of direction, once you understand the areas you will become an expert. The ship's resources are finite so you must administer them well, at all costs. Special Features * This game allows you to change languages while playing and instantly, without having to restart the game, you can do it from the main menu or in the title screen menu. * It Has An Extra Mini Game: Survival. This mini game is all about evading asteroids and beat your previous record, then you can receive something useful for the main campaign. This mode will be automatically unlocked while you progress on the story. * The game comes in three modalities of challenge: Normal, Difficult and Expert. * It has narrative elements, especially in the cut scenes and the final documents that tell the story of the ship. About the Gameplay The gameplay is based on interfaces and getting items to survive while you go moving through maps by dodging what might be called a maze game, all in an isometric view with an original pixel art style. The duration of the game is variable depending on how good you are: an average of 3 to 5 hours in the Normal difficulty is expected for the first try, and you can SpeedRun it to approach your best time (that is showcased in the general data on the title menu). Audience Due to the complexity of some terms as well as certain dramatic situations, the estimated age rating is +12. For Gamers who want an indie and retro adventure game on a mysterious spacecraft with pixel-by-pixel graphics, simple gameplay and a different approach style, discover and survive aboard the Astrolarix. Defining Considerations * The Game Is Dedicated to A Linear Progress. * There is no combat system as such; it is more dedicated to going around evading obstacles and solving riddles to scape certain areas. * Is a game made in RPG MAKER MV but is completely personalized, music, ambient sounds, interfaces, characters and everything else. * It does not have replayability, once you finish the main story and you have unlocked the documents of the game there is nothing more to do. Except if you want to try it again in a greater difficulty, in that case, you will have fewer resources and the enemies will do more damage. You can use the Delete data section to restart your progress from the title menu.","['English', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Spanish - Latin America']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1073790/header.jpg?t=1605593980,,,artificercreator_contact@protonmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,1,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Artificer Creator,Artificer Creator,"Single-player,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Casual,Indie","Adventure,Indie,Casual,Pixel Graphics","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1073790/ss_48641576a5c3518dcc47acab26f07fbcc60712c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605593980,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1073790/ss_10eb2f92c17f2230295de1940b262e44d1cfe26b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605593980,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1073790/ss_df935d90005597967dde8093305eb6f3d4cb0949.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605593980,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1073790/ss_3e8aec306751907e1083cffbad227d4aa77f69ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605593980,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1073790/ss_9904c07da237f906de0443b052eeb825cf9256b0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605593980,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1073790/ss_023ce004780a153d261353bef20d7684cc205d91.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605593980,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1073790/ss_51d78348415ab2947b0758746904713f689db9e2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605593980,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1073790/ss_f14ba92a7f5624140a5eb921f7236ce6200e3fb4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605593980","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256749346/movie_max.mp4?t=1558146457,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256750973/movie_max.mp4?t=1558156094"

Spectacular Sparky is an action-packed platform/shooter with wacky characters, explosive weapons and boss battles to treasure. Sparky is an adorably insane intergalactic bounty hunter who can dash through obstacles, fire his weapons in any direction and even extend his jumps by flapping his long space-rabbit ears. Each time he brings down a boss, his connected confidante Shigg (half shark, half pig) is ready to point him in the direction of yet another space fugitive. In the grand tradition of irreverent 1990s video-game heroes, Spectacular Sparky is as sassy as he is fearless. His voice-acted wisecracks and sarcastic jabs tend to get under the skin of his enemies in a most amusing fashion. And his universe is awash with spikes, lava, buzzsaws, super-saturated colors, slick parallax scrolling and mega-driven music, the way every game ought to be. Features • A modern homage to the golden age of white-gloved 16-bit video-game mascots • Dozens of delightful story scenes featuring full voice acting and a host of outrageous characters • Five challenging worlds with 24 levels, each with a bombastic boss battle at the end • Five powerful weapon types, including blasters, flamethrowers and homing missiles • Five unique vehicles that Sparky can pilot, including a spaceship, hang glider and lava jet ski • Five difficulty settings, from Supercasual to Supernightmare • Three game modes (What?!

What seems to be a normal visit for the two tourists becomes a haunted mystery. Lore: Curse Of The Elemental is the first installment of the Lore game series. Adventure, horror, action, and mystery lie ahead. This game was inspired by Uncharted, Tomb Raider, Indiana Jones, and The Mummy and is sure to surprise all newcomers as it makes its own unique footprint in the adventure genre. This short adventure involves mystery, puzzle solving, third person perspective, shotgun shooting, jump scares, and many cinematic cutscenes. The location is based off of a real location in Ireland that is said to be actually haunted. My wife and I visited in 2019 and were greatly inspired by our experience there. All purchases of this game will be used to finance our next game Lore: The Secret Order. Before playing the game I recommend to visit the 'options' menu and select the optimize option. This should configure the game to match your system.

Story The story begins when our heroine, Erin, arrives to the town of Azuliris, following the trail of a mysterious witch who, rumors say, carries a very valuable treasure with her. Things get difficult when in Azuliris, Erin meets the ShyGirls, a group of bandits who have taken control over the town, blocking all the exits and locking the local police force, 'The Eyes', in the station cells. If Erin wants to find the witch, she will have to get rid of the ShyGirls and free Azuliris. But she doesn't know her journey is just begining and a new adventure awaits her, along with the strangest and wicked characters she have ever met. The Characters Erin: A weirdo who refuses to kill her foes, so she goes around doing weird stuff like cutitng their clothes off or crippling them for life. She thinks she doesn't have enemies, only potential friends. Erin fears stupid things like rainbows and butterflies. She love videogames, but really sucks at them. Rina: A greedy little thing who would betray her mother for the right price (if she had a mother). Erin and Rina agree to find together the witch's treasure, but they end up involved in a much bigger deal. At the end of their journey, she may find that the real treasure, is friendship... pfffff! of course she doesn't! Most people asumes she's a fairy, a sprite or an imp, but the truth is unkown. Star: Erin's adoptive sister, she's also her 'best friend'. Her usefulness doesn't go beyond letting Erin save the game every time she calls by phone. She hides her insecurities by wearing provocative clothes. Star loves animals, specially kittens. Like Erin, Star is a videogames fan, her favorite franchise is 'Acid Princess Durazno'. ShyGirls: While they call themselves bounty hunters, the truth is, they are just a bunch of good for nothing bandits who go around looking for the ultimate treasure. Their attire comes from a misinterpretation of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale. If you want to know more characters, better play the game. You don't want me to spoil everything here for you.","['English', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/823420/header.jpg?t=1533713708,https://www.facebook.com/ErinyeGame/,https://www.facebook.com/ErinyeGame/,,True,False,False,0,,0,72,8,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Karosu-Maker,Karosu-Maker,Single-player,"Nudity,Violent,Adventure,Indie,RPG","Nudity,Adventure,Violent,RPG,Indie,RPGMaker,Anime,Sexual Content,Action RPG,Action","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/823420/ss_74e79a051d66de5632e3ec21bb01efba8af40e25.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533713708,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/823420/ss_e2c502127a15510a9cb5654b2d44c6f25fedc570.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533713708,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/823420/ss_acd63f4c4e31a2455651e45d614054a0ce274021.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533713708,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/823420/ss_634305ddfc20e6e40ad8afc154c7b11840aae031.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533713708,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/823420/ss_f0fe1a55e5b69edf0a137be84eea4e20e42d946c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533713708,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/823420/ss_35d24641f5d53964d1767f15440fbdf9d008571c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533713708,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/823420/ss_4ea4f7dd4e9a31a61d244287cad414572eb48d47.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533713708,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/823420/ss_82c603be013764cacc8bba4c819857d9c997aa91.1920x1080.jpg?t=1533713708",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256712321/movie_max.mp4?t=1521774872

2430190,FlippedDream,"Jun 5, 2023",0 - 20000,0,0,1.59,0,0,"Introduction FlippedDream is a physically-based, 3D-platformer and maze-exploring game, developed by Unreal Engine 4. You will get into 14 different mazes, trying to find the exit through your exploration. At the same time, you can change the direction of the global gravity to go into different channels or avoid obstacles. When the gravity is rotating, your camera is rotating as well, causing the loss of your sense of directions. And this would be your biggest challenge during the gameplay. FlippedDream is my graduation project, developed on my own, for the first time. It is not perfect indeed, but hopes to become a part of your memories of video games. Control A/D: Move left/right. Space: Jump. Q/E：Rotate the global gravity clockwise/counter clockwise, 90 degrees for each time. You can not change it again until it finishes doing so. Esc: Pause; Levels The game consists of 5 chapters and 14 levels. You will be faced of multiple obstacles too. 1. Simple gravity item Some items' gravity directions would also change as the global gravity changes, but some would not. They have their unique gravity. 2. Single pendulum Single pendulum is an anchor, connected to a 'simple gravity item' by a cable. 3. Gravity converter In charpter 3, the player would not be allowed to change gravity at any time, you can only change it when touching the 'gravity converter'. 4. The fan The big fan would be continuesly rotating slowly, blocking the items when contacting them. 5. Diseased cells Diseased cells and harmful to healthy ones. When a health cell contacts a diseased one, it would get illed and die. So make sure to avoid them in any case. Additional notes 1. No solution If an obstacle is stucked in a channel especially which would lead to the exit, you could consider loading the last check point. This would reload the whole level. 2. Adjusting resolution in fullscreen mode causes the app to flicker or stutter Maybe it is because you have installed NVIDIA Game Ready Driver 461.09 or newer. You could find solutions in NVIDIA SUPPORT.","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/header.jpg?t=1686105834,,,chaelkenway@163.com,True,False,False,0,,0,2,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,YUZHU PRODUCTIONS,YUZHU PRODUCTIONS,"Single-player,Partial Controller Support","Adventure,Indie,Strategy","Strategy,3D Platformer,Dungeon Crawler,Puzzle-Platformer,Puzzle,Adventure,Atmospheric,Emotional,Third Person,Relaxing,Linear,Stylized,Indie,Logic,Drama,Physics,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_9703f4e7e0d55f7be906c0731c0cf1da99ab75da.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_927554d6d96b2ccb2db4a8e481e66d354ac7bed3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_4c50e93c890ed29dc178c572b83cdfcc6ca2c398.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_115ba14090338d874e533080f6fa76e63ddc6d0e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_7503012056dbf7aef4d19132c8a0f06763127478.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_21e96d4ab777a0fcff096dcd0b162fdb358fd882.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_d655330706878df9a2c646422005111e997e50f1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_578282cb4ed00f555a7a1805849586640e2fa1fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_29346b49a7d2a7d3dddacae4b5770a87e0ee12c6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_52e8718dae34e73e4b6b17efe09e95dd6f7fc382.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_03a8f76e717dd1d9ce96c51d5210ab78c1b927a7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2430190/ss_1712154c08ff486580073c18e0e0cb6755f4bff4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1686105834",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256946964/movie_max.mp4?t=1684293440

Backup only in town: You don't decide when you save the game. It happens automatically when entering and leaving a town. So when you leave a city, make sure you have what it takes. Fights and quests, it's all the way: You cannot flee a fight or stop a quest in progress. Quick fight: When you keep the attack button pressed, the fight takes place automatically. Remember to watch your life. The food: Each move on the map uses a food ration. Don't forget to buy some. Controls: The game is played with the gamepad or the keyboard. You can change the configuration of keyboard controls.","['English', 'French', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/header.jpg?t=1674201669,https://xploquest.blogspot.com,https://xploquest.blogspot.com,,True,True,True,0,,0,4,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,33 Production,33 Production,"Single-player,Full controller support","Adventure,RPG","RPG,Adventure,Exploration,Fantasy,Turn-Based Combat,2D,Cute,Dungeon Crawler,Action RPG,CRPG,Top-Down,Medieval,Open World,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_c2b3b2254d7962cf4cdadfbf59e4b09a3951d5eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_3bc3e9c61fd6eb76fea151c7c79bb547138ecef7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_8991f15080af65807dc57523688d113dc11c9600.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_25c257d6e4d868dab35c043fc1623464f2538f9c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_7a06a3b682e2dc82b186cf21bb82daa6f0e86775.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_70e04a39b07220f872786c235aed8b970d560f3a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_f4a0ee231dc89a60ca781496d7ea4c9381b7e8d4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_f1038ef4332d5048d7ad58f812beb89f04c8ec46.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_2abbec23814937a7de73e2e1a7c3ef6a8a311993.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_b1b2e162d09b3a5639c1c9512d0383735e90f50e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_60b4f3e84e0a2edc587054260bb17645fbcc1d83.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_29f58c78f43ff9ce1284c254a65ed43c4635dc81.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_2ecafb3be1bac3922e6b677d20596c767c4d937c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_d047341e39bb9a2a18392ed8ddd5304007efa56f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_11217ef1e28e131ed92b874a7bde4db9b7a41e06.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_dabba9694ee8983b88cba09fc0cac41c0601189a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_e6c735f9ad4d90068866e8d7630551a083da5c60.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2267770/ss_865ebb244a15a66afd4faa696ad6a2288ea92af2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1674201669",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256923440/movie_max.mp4?t=1673018923

You must settle in a new land, so collect resources, train with your master, and grow stronger by learning powerful skills!! For those just looking to experience the story, there are 2 distinct modes. Full rpg experience with combat (10-18 hours), or… “Adventure Mode” (4-6 hours), which removes the element of combat and strategy, but leaves the story, puzzles, and exploration to enjoy! Key Features/Mechanics A cave painting come to life! Most progression comes from exploration, find items to raise your stats. Some of the best skills require items to learn too, so choose wisely! Heal in between battles by eating/hunting the small animals such as bats, squirrels, and lizards. Also recovers SP used for many skills, so you can keep on moving. Just make sure to have enough stamina in order to DASH. Many skills push or pull enemies. This changes what skills they can use in battle as well as some stats. Line them up strategically to hit multiple enemies with a single attack! Timed button presses are needed for some skills, so stay on your toes! Open progression system: Animals in your party can be upgraded by finding items. Their HP and SP will go up with each level but the other stats are up to you! Choose many new skills to learn with EV points, even from the start! Create some powerful synergies with your team! Puzzles and variety in every area: Use clues in your journal to solve various puzzles. Or just figure them out on your own… maybe… Use various plants in the environment to refill stamina instantly, see hidden tracks, or gain temporary power 2 versions; one for RPG veterans and one for those who just want to experience the story 10-18 hours to complete the game in the normal version Developer Profile: I am a therapist in Santa Ana, California. I currently live with my wife, two cats, and one dog. This is my second game so far. I’m a life-long gamer, (growing up with two brothers, we played a ton of different games) and an RPG lover.

Featuring many Rogue-like elements, Magicite randomly generates each underground dungeon for you and your friends to delve deep into. Chop trees, mine ores, and hunt beasts in order to collect the resources and materials you need to survive the harsh and unforgiving environment. With a ton of character traits, stats, companions, and classes, players will have a different experience each play through! Be prepared to die... A LOT. Magicite's main influences were Monster Hunter and Spelunky. I loved the resource collection and crafting in Monster Hunter, and of course fighting giant monsters with my friends. Spelunky's brutal yet rewarding platforming was also something that I wanted to capture with Magicite. Features: Randomly Generated Dungeons - Experience a new dungeon each time you play. Expect tons of trees to chop, ores to mine, plants to harvest, and bugs to catch! Oh and giant monsters. Permanent Death - The game logs all of your stats in a play through, leading the way for achievements and upgrades. Crafting System - Combine any two items to create a new one! For example, Wood + Wood = Plank. There are tons of combinations to discover! Combat System - If you plan on just running in and swinging you sword, you're gonna get wrecked. Take time to craft useful items and examine enemy positioning before executing a well timed attack. Unlockable Races, Hats, &amp; Companions - The more you play, more greater chance you'll unlock awesome new hats with a variety of special effects. Races and Companions can also be unlocked to provide different starting items and stats! Multiplayer - Want to put your friendships to the test? This is the game to do it! Permanent death only occurs when the ENTIRE party has fallen. So if your buddy gets knocked out feel free to run over and help him back up.

Your main goal is to obtain the lost Artefact within the chosen area. In the area you've chosen are the enemies and they don't want you to obtain their artefact. So you have to fight for your own life. Enemies: 1. Beast -&gt; Tank type of Monster, with decent amount of health and with big claws, which does a pretty solid damage. He is a close range monster. 2. Patient -&gt; Not a very smart entity. He likes walking around, but if he sees you, then he will chase after you, gives average damage, few bullets can take him down. 3. Porter -&gt; Something like a mage, but not as smart, the only spell he knows how to summon a fireball, that aims at you and he can teleport himself somewhere that is close to you. He is really annoying and hard to hit. He can be taken down by few bullets. But you must hit him first (It's hard to hit him). 4. Keeper -&gt; Has good Health and gives even better Damage. his only goal is to keep his artefact all for himself. And he will track you from the moment you will arrive, to the moment you will leave. But be aware! If you pick up the artefact, he will get in 'rage mode' (2x Health,2x Damage) If this is too easy for you, you can make it harder in lobby by sellecting higher difficulty (adds more enemy damage, as well as ability to regenerate their health if their are not fighting) Or you can give yourself less time to achieve your main goal (finding artefact) You can choose from 3 avatar options: A. Tiffany: Has Medium Hp and Damage. She's eqquiped with her favorite weapon the 'MP5', with total of 150 deadly bullets, as for her second best friend there is P320 With xx? bullets,and of course nobody can go on a mission without knife, and in the darkest areas, you would like to see something, so you can use the flashlight attached to her shoulder. B. Scout: Big fan of M4A4 (with xx bullets prepared to be used) and a Colt 1911 (with xx bullets also prepared to be used), he has a sharp knife, ready for this job and also has a flashlight. C. Igor : No Face, no skin to be seen, just a suit. but he is cool (i hope so) carrying an Ak (xx Rounds) and with his favorite handgun Baretta(xx Rounds). Also has a knife (I half expected it to be made out of wood) but he is sharp... at least he said he is. (Also owns Flashlight attached to his left Shoulder) Areas: 1. Area 1 -&gt; Secret Laboratory, with big Corridors, lots of doors and plenty of space. 2. Area 2 -&gt; Pyramid in Desert. You have to find a way into the middle of the pyramid, to face the Special Artefact keeper, if you defeat him, you can pick up the artefact and leave.

The game is set in a ancient fantasy world of kings, wizards and fearsome creatures. When a powerful empire invades the lands governed by humans all the realms are plunged into a great conflict.

1520760,Tyrant's Blessing,"Aug 8, 2022",0 - 20000,0,0,15.99,0,1,"The Tyrant landed in Tyberia bearing promises of a paradise, without war, without suffering… and without death. All Tyberians had to do in order to enter his paradise was to simply die at the hands of his Dead Army. The war was over before it even began, with thousands perishing in the Tyrant's wake, only to be brought into his fold as undying thralls, bound by magic. The few living warriors left are scattered across the remnants of their homeland, tirelessly looking for a way to turn the tables on the tyrannical Tyrant. Lead a great Uprising, defeat the Dead Army, and drive the monstrous overlord back into the depths of the sea from whence he came. Tyrant's Blessing is a tactical turn-based game where your ability to plan, adapt, and strategize is more important than min-maxing your units or finding the sharpest sword in the hoard. Select battles every day, make challenging choices, and cleverly use the strengths of these rag-tag insurgents to defeat the undead hordes and maybe - just maybe - bring real life back to Tyberia. Before you bring the battle to the Tyrant's doorstep, you'll have to make sure you live long enough to reclaim the Island. Decide whether to fight, rescue the living from the Undying, or gather your strength. Every choice matters throughout every day of the Uprising. As you fight your way across the face of Tyberia, face off against random encounters that force difficult decisions. Do you intervene and fight highwaymen, putting your warriors at risk? Do you try to save a child, risking valuable time and resources? Only your morals and ideals hold the answer. Pick your heroic roster carefully. Screeg, the elder wizard advising the Uprising, can only teleport three heroes and a pet at once: Do you send your elite warriors in? Or rookies to train and hold the line? Are they up to the task? Can you handle the consequences? The Tyrant can’t be defeated without destroying an army's worth of the Undying. However, winning is more than simply whacking the enemy as hard as you can. Analyze the fray and plan accordingly. Place warriors around the battlefield to gain strategic advantages. Stay ever mindful of surroundings: kick up dust to make the enemies lose sight or hop over stones and dodge into bushes to avoid enemy attacks. Mind the enemy: every attack is telegraphed, but take care, simply moving away leaves behind a shadow. This remnant of a character can still be attacked if there is no way to avoid it... Knock the enemies out of the way and into obstacles, shield weaker heroes with ones that can tank damage, as well as chain powerful elemental attacks using the environment. Brute force works, but fight smarter, not harder. Each of your heroes has their own personality, properties, and abilities. Who will you choose to put in harm’s way? Enlist twenty hallowed heroes, each with a distinct set of abilities that can dramatically alter the course of any battle. But stay mindful: Not all heroes appear in a playthrough - and not everyone is guaranteed to make it to the finish line of this quest. Pick the right team for the task. An assassin may thrive in confined spaces, while an archer will suffer in close quarters. Some heroes may even bring their pets along, who might provide just enough leverage to win a battle for the group. Even if heroes fall, they can still be freed from the Tyrant's grasp. Track them down, defeat them in combat, and restore them back to their stolen life!","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Russian', 'Portuguese - Brazil']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/header.jpg?t=1660053849,,,keyrequests@freedom.gg,True,True,True,0,,0,59,27,,54,0,,0,0,0,0,Mercury Game Studio,Freedom Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support","Indie,RPG,Strategy","Tactical RPG,Rogue-like,Strategy,Turn-Based Combat,Procedural Generation,Female Protagonist,Turn-Based Tactics,Turn-Based Strategy,Simulation,JRPG,RPG,Rogue-lite,2.5D,Isometric,Anime,Pixel Graphics,Dark Fantasy,Fantasy,Singleplayer,Perma Death","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_640f26702d0ae0058e8e535f71060bc2336ae0cb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_a4c1d9de0b943505a0d1d62c0e2f5d348c40ebac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_26e5a50ed446963f759f7c5dd1de91881819fe01.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_322d26ba093650180ccff18655f2b11b5d04cea8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_4b5b71a03b1fcc10c868666dbffead5bb5bacdc7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_daf8cee3bd42452b6fc8a92d8b02344958e21193.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_80db88d41992a2982f45f1144d96c595becbdcc7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_8f9197d3ed7dfa447a8bf9a8a904d1d3d25978ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_6b4e66ce1185a7bbfb7524db41a5113a66b37977.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_57ce04b9cd5b3caedf8ff9d714b35909be8484bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_3183dad54d8fc052be6fb9bfed14f469d33af2a4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_37eb2e1aadc2c6a57dde466660b755cdab35078d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_cf813b893553d3053b58edc499ba78343cd10c98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1520760/ss_f204f8a5f5eb33dd2d4e98e360bd37e1fde9bf59.1920x1080.jpg?t=1660053849","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256899983/movie_max.mp4?t=1659974401,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256891067/movie_max.mp4?t=1654891942"

407630,Skein,"Nov 13, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,6.99,0,0,"Run The Procedural Gauntlet! Skein is a procedural dungeon shooter in the 'old-skool' arcade style for one or two players where you must battle through hordes of monsters on a quest to save the soul of a talking sheep. A group of intrepid adventurers are travelling through a wasteland when they come across a sheep... feeling peckish, they do what any self-respecting adventurer would do and they slaughter it without a thought, only to find out that it was a magic sheep with the soul of a great warrior prince trapped within. Feeling a tad guilty for condemning the warrior prince to an eternity of spiritual suffering, the adventurers decide to enter the legendary Skein to find his body and return his soul to it (and get loads, and loads, and loads, and loads of loot while they're at it...). Skein is a one or two player (co-op) arcade game with the following features: Procedural dungeons 6 unique characters, with three unique classes A huge number of class based spells Over 40 unique enemies, each with their own traits and talents Special areas like the Arena, the Vault and the Caves Local, Online and Steam leaderboards 40+ achievements 1 or 2 Player (co-op) play Sheep!!!!! Skein was created by me over the course of three years as a homage to the coin-op arcade machines of old. While the game itself has many modern features, at its heart the gameplay is decidedly 'old skool' and can be picked up and played for five minutes or several hours, either on your own or with a friend. The concept is simple: fight through ever-bigger dungeons with ever-growing hordes of enemies in an attempt to liberate the corpse of a disembodied sheep... although all that is simply a pretext for getting as much loot as possible and for surviving as long as possible. On your journey to certain death you can use the magic spells you find to wipe the floor with the enemy, and friends can drop into the game at any time to help you with the carnage. Later levels feature fiendish traps and huge Champion monsters which have their own special attacks and powers. NOTE!

It is the first game of the story 'Celestial'. In 2069, unknown alien creatures from space suddenly attacked the Earth, killing more than half of the population of major cities in the world within seven days. The governments and giant technology companies of various countries on the earth have decided to invest all human resources to build five giant starships that can propagate civilization before the human population is extinct, so as to spread the human kind of fire into the universe. Command the role to defend the starship Players choose to command the special operations forces of the Human Revolutionary Federation, the White Bear Heavy Industry and the UNION. There are currently a total of 9 different roles, forming a three-person team. Take the shuttle to fight the alien creatures on the earth and destroy them before the alien creatures destroy the built starship! Defend the completion of five giant starships and set sail. Every battle takes place on a 9x9 war chess map. Commanding roles make full use of terrain obstacles and equipment characteristics to complete battles that win more with less. More than 24 types of equipment The game contains four different types of weapons, including sharpness, skill, reloading, and science, as well as general props and equipment, with a total of more than 24 types. There are also hidden weapons produced by capturing alien creatures. Each character can carry two weapons into battle, and arm the squad through a reasonable combination. More than 81 chips and skills Three chips can be inserted into each weapon, and some rare chips provide powerful capabilities that the weapon itself does not have. The right role is matched with the right weapon, and the powerful chip combination can raise the combat effectiveness to a higher dimension. Scene and starship The shapes and construction methods of the five starships are completely different. One directly transform urban buildings as part of the interior of the starship, with a large number of facilities. One directly use ice and frozen soil as the hull of the spacecraft on the snow-capped mountains, latitude launch saves energy, and at the same time comes with a lot of fresh water. One use the energy of lava on the side of volcanoes for construction and energy storage. Different starships and scenes have different styles of alien enemies and loot rewards. The hidden earth forces and its undisclosed sixth starship under construction are waiting to be discovered by the commander.","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1828700/header.jpg?t=1655870358,https://kumapaw.com,https://kumapaw.com,contact@kumapaw.com,True,True,False,0,,0,12,6,,22,0,,0,0,0,0,KumaPaw,KumaPaw,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud",Strategy,"Strategy,Turn-Based Combat,Rogue-lite,Sci-fi,Anime,Mechs,Rogue-like,2D,Aliens,Singleplayer,Turn-Based Strategy,Turn-Based Tactics,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1828700/ss_10c739b75b7192894709fd269fc241df72e1882f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655870358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1828700/ss_bf19e77ba5af88d8b27ebdc449858bb0734656a3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655870358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1828700/ss_0e8de99f5987bf9eae52389928550843e75323a2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655870358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1828700/ss_c7d9be84d0562065ca55a68f0587235d580d0533.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655870358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1828700/ss_2bb673e7444b436b5e20c9290cfb50efae99ae14.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655870358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1828700/ss_8b59480768071be80e4a09ef921c928919b985fb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655870358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1828700/ss_ec3dc527e76fb74bd1bc076f39dde8b417acd42b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655870358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1828700/ss_4ab736422a27e56d7b2952ef0924bb7b4d9951bc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655870358","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256888299/movie_max.mp4?t=1653468988,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256888297/movie_max.mp4?t=1653468993"

It is a story of a girl with dream skills playing in her own dream! 'Dreams are my playground, and I can go anywhere with my dreams, and I can make things that can not happen in reality!' The protagonist is a student and a dream talent (a lucid dreamer). Ability to create and change Her dreams at will. And a little unusual taste with an interest in the old stories of the eastern countries. Yeon-seul(protagonist) visits the school and sees the world in the news. I think so. 'It's nice to enjoy other cultures ...' 'Why are we so indifferent to our (Korean peninsula)? I think we can make good things ... ' In the meantime, Yeon-seul such as the story of the Korean peninsula or myths were investigated. I was really interested in this as well. One day, she was playing with his dreams as usual. By the way, I felt like being attracted to someone. It is the place where it came to be attracted to the HyunMongDoWon ... The place where the feeling of the village which was in the old Korean peninsula is scattered. I do not know who led me, but I really like it because I was dreaming about this kind of atmosphere. So the story began. My game is important for fun, but also for storytelling. So there are some dialogue in the game, and you can see the stories related to the game in the menu other than game play.

A new organization has risen from the ashes of the Supernatural Response Team, and you are its leader. Take command and decide how it evolves. Unnatural Season Two is a 700,000 word interactive horror novel by Sam Kabell, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Encounter Unnaturals both old and new. You’ve dealt with vampires, werewolves, and zombies before, but how will you handle new and previously unknown threats? How will you handle the awakening of once dormant Unnaturals, an ancient danger beyond anything anyone living has faced? Reforge bonds with the surviving members of the SRT and make some new friends and allies, too. Interview and recruit up to four potential teammates: Avery Daye, a detective who specializes in missing persons related to Unnatural cases; Jennifer Maki, a former veterinarian trained to deal with animal-based Unnaturals; Cassandra Brown, a former member of the Boston Branch of the SRT—or have your actions in Season One set you up to recruit a mysterious returning companion? Import your Unnatural Season One save to find out! As you move deeper into the Unnatural world, your journey continues to be shaped by it. Past is present as further investigation into your heritage brings new revelations to light. Evolve your power and learn more about the origins of the Azure, potentially discovering how their powers shape your own. People look to you to protect the innocent from these intersections where the everyday and the supernatural collide. Play as male, female or nonbinary; be straight, gay, bi or choose to focus on friendship instead. Continue your romance with your paramour from Season One or pursue one of five new love interests. Guide Silver Cross Incorporated to protect the innocent from foes human and Unnatural alike. Manage your funding between four departments: research, security, technology, and training. The responsibility and consequences are yours. Choose which cases you take on and who you bring with you—will you bring the best person for the job or will you bring someone you want to get to know better? Utilize an updated threat level system to identify which cases your team takes on, maximizing their chances for both success and survival. Focus on your powers, or rely on your technology. Not all cases need to end in violence; maybe you can talk your way out? Your time for following orders is done.

The Mansion, a grim yet fascinating building you’re facing, doesn’t exist. Maybe it once existed, but when? And was it just like this? Maybe it simply resembles the existing one or maybe it was only assembled from scraps of memories, both real and those created in books, films, or on old postcards? The construction in front of us, although looking robust, seems to have been built from the nightmarish memories of a tormented boy. And it stands in the very center of his nightmare. One rainy day, cold as old bones that no duvet can warm up anymore, there was a faint knocking on the door to your small-town doctor’s office. It was a stranger, a thin young boy with a face prematurely aged by suffering, who was knocking with his last strength. He fell motionless in front of you, mumbling something unintelligible. You carried him to the couch, covered him with a blanket, and bent down to examine him. Then you looked into his eyes that were like bottomless wells and felt that you were falling down straight into his dream. Now you’re standing in front of The Mansion and you know you’re not leaving until you face the fears and painful memories of this boy. And the monsters from his dreams seem weirdly real to you – perfectly capable of doing you real harm.

2070000,Heavy Burden,"Sep 11, 2023",0 - 20000,0,0,4.99,0,0,"'Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined,' wrote Albert Camus, and it is hard to disagree with this. To contemplate one's life means to knock oneself down, to stop, to begin to go over one's experiences, to discard the superfluous and unnecessary, to destroy the old in the hope of constructing the new, in other words, to be undermined. It is impossible not to note the severity of this word because this action is associated with pain, loss, the need to choose difficult routes, and sometimes taking risks so as not to make new mistakes and not to fall off the set path. But is it worth enduring the pain? What happens if we simply go with the flow? How will our lives turn out then? The French philosopher Albert Camus asked similar questions in his famous essay 'The Myth of Sisyphus. In brief, the ancient Greek myth is as follows: the gods condemned Sisyphus, because he was too arrogant and too dodgy, to roll a huge stone up the mountain, which kept falling and had to start all over again. It would seem that what could be worse than this useless work? What was Sisyphus thinking as he climbed to the top of the mountain? And what do we care about him? Maybe we should admit that our lives are a bit like this Sisyphus? Approach Albert Camus's thoughts and feelings, his philosophy. Perhaps you will find some answers to these difficult questions. Explore the world around you and find philosophical notes. Take the stone to the top, higher and higher, and if it falls, well, start over, that's your punishment. Choose your path correctly. Your decisions will determine the end of the game. Discover the philosophy of Albert Camus. Don't try to understand every word, just let it pass through you. Enjoy the abstract game world, and find different ways of passing. And also listen to atmospheric music and sound effects.","['English', 'Russian', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Thai', 'Turkish', 'Japanese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/header.jpg?t=1700676556,https://store.steampowered.com/app/755980/_DEPLOYMENT/,https://store.steampowered.com/app/1852830/SPACE_ACCIDENT/,info@whalerockgames.com,True,False,False,0,,0,104,14,,13,117,,0,0,0,0,Whale Rock Games,Whale Rock Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Casual,Indie,Simulation,Sports,Strategy","Casual,Adventure,Strategy,Logic,Platformer,Action-Adventure,Puzzle,Turn-Based Strategy,RTS,3D Platformer,Choose Your Own Adventure,Puzzle-Platformer,3D,First-Person,Atmospheric,Survival,Investigation,Story Rich,Open World,Physics","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/ss_1ed8898ef6fbef9ae325828446efa6106cb5a70a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700676556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/ss_7827036c824245b14455338ce3b7a3bbd4e16fc0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700676556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/ss_33824d999be2bbea77ef15a3c5ff71c58cbd86a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700676556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/ss_8348972cd0c8dc6de8ddb52d4b300fbd0a40d16f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700676556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/ss_3bc8f12135c8b081973b4c7b6383ec57cf54bfac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700676556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/ss_1952890065f26ef40da92c3ea5bb27f5b063dee6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700676556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/ss_a9149c575947e3cbc699fc8ed33ac0a20ba2fe46.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700676556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/ss_5dba538be75a34c8905767b7122690e1cc29732a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700676556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/ss_e6c69c69b0bf2d4f078af44582ce3c5516bf6596.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700676556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/ss_9c31d6b91fd2874a0a610ee1f0460e603a379493.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700676556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2070000/ss_99b41f48d47da16a9cb85e378150afc134b1c870.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700676556",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256894241/movie_max.mp4?t=1697815678

The experience is suitable for home VR users and we also encourage museums and attractions who want to experiment with room-scale VR but are struggling to find appropriate educational material to give it a try. Check out our early access details to read more about what we have planned in the future, this is just the start of building our virtual museum and we want to know what you want to see in it. We are actively looking for museum and science centre partners who are interested in finding ways to digitise and explore their collections in VR.

2492030,RBM Studio's Gettysburg,"Dec 14, 2023",0 - 20000,4,0,4.99,0,0,"In RBM Studio's Gettysburg, take command of either the Confederate or Union forces for the Battle of Gettysburg, the single bloodiest battle of the U.S. Civil War. Each side has an historically accurate order of battle that details when and where reinforcements will arrive, letting the player attempt to outdo the generals of history. As the Confederate commander Lee, it's your task to either crush the Union forces or secure a safe route for your continued invasion of the North. As the Union commander Meade, you must at least match the losses inflicted by the Confederates while also securing the roads leaving Gettysburg towards D.C. RBM Studio's Gettysburg features gameplay based on the historical wargaming boardgames of the 70's and 80's. Players maneuver markers that represent their units on a hexagonal map that mimics the gameboard and cardboard counters of traditional boardgames. Turns are completed in an 'I go, you go' style, wherein players alternate their turns with their opponent until one player passes. Once that happens, a random number of unopposed actions are given to their opponent. Pass too early and you risk giving your opponent the opportunity to maneuver completely around your forces. Combat is resolved through die rolls modified by terrain, battle line factors, and the use of artillery support. Attackers benefit from flanking defenders. Defenders benefit from being in defensible terrain. Artillery support is a finite resource, so think carefully about when to use it. If both players use artillery in an engagement, an artillery duel is conducted in which at most one player will receive the bonus but both players risk losing additional artillery support if their opponent's cannon manage to hit their own. The Confederates begin the game with less artillery support but ultimately receive more units and benefit from a greater area of influence generated by General Lee. Only the Union player can deploy a special sharpshooter unit that protects a single hex from the Confederate advance. Careful placement of this unit can help block a Confederate advance farther into the North. Key Features Command your units in an historically accurate representation of the real Battle of Gettysburg. Maneuver to try and pin your opponent's forces, while keeping your own free to act. Manage your artillery usage to avoid being overrun late in the game if your opponent still has resources left. Choose your fights carefully - losing artillery and men attempting to capture a well-defended hex without adequate preparation is a sure path to defeat. Solo play as both sides to explore the rules and potential strategies.

1356040,Ampersat,"May 6, 2022",50000 - 100000,0,0,4.99,0,0,"Ampersat is a shooty, slashy, RPG-y game mixing old-school/retro and modern sensibilities. A blend of influences from Gauntlet and Smash TV to Zelda and a dash of Angband, this is a handcrafted adventure with much appeal to fans of Roguelites. A labor of love from a solo developer, Ampersat distills some favorite childhood gaming experiences into a fresh, fun hybrid that sees you killing a lot of monsters, finding a lot of loot, freeing captured letters (um, what?) and growing from a world-weary warrior mage into a powerful smashing/blasting machine! Main Features More than 50 handcrafted levels, many with exploration and light puzzles Optional endless procedural area Original gameplay elements based around freeing and capturing letters Flexible character progression with extensive skill tree Hundreds of unique pieces of loot find, buy, sell and augment Upgradeable town hub Tackle stages in the order you choose 50 unique creature types with individual AI, 10 fiendish bosses Drop-in local async co-op (and online using Steam Remote Play Together) - suitable for young players to team up with their parents You may notice the main character and enemies are ASCII letters - yes, this is an aesthetic throwback to the original Rogue games, and the blending of these with colorful 3D top-down environments was the idea that first spawned Ampersat. Likewise, Commodore 64 SID chip sound effects are used alongside real-world music for a distinctive experience. But just what is an 'ampersat?' It's the leading contender for the official name of the @ symbol, of course! Overview Gentlheim has been invaded by Lord Z, who has surrounded the village with 5 extraplanar towers and the dungeons beneath, filled with evil creatures. Even worse, he has stolen language itself from the townspeople! As the warrior mage Ampersat, you must venture deep into the dungeons and high above the land in the treacherous towers, defeat countless minions and restore language to Gentlheim so the townsfolk can communicate properly and help you defeat Lord Z himself. Gentlheim Gentlheim has shops to buy and sell goods; an Inn to heal up, level up, and stash gold to retrieve after death; and a deep Well leading to randomly generated procedural levels. There are various structures you can pay to upgrade and, as language returns to the village, townsfolk who may need something... Gentlheim hides a few surprises for the inquisitive gamer and provides a hub area to approach different stages in any order you like, or revisit levels you’ve already beaten. The Well is where the “roguish” aesthetics are turned up to 11, providing short, sharp, loot-gathering deep delves once you repair it. There’s an old rumor that something very special is buried at the bottom of the well… but no one has ever reached those depths. Co-op Ampersat’s async co-op is true drop-in, drop-out at any time. The second player controls a fairy that hovers around Ampersat and also launches attacks. Will you trust them with your best spell? No? They might steal it anyway... While the fairy’s shots aren't as powerful and contribute to overheating, it has the huge advantage of being invulnerable. The perfect partner... if you can get along.","['English', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Czech', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Italian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Turkish']","['English', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Czech', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Italian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Turkish']","“If you love games that continually surprise you with clever design and old-fashioned RPG grinding that isn’t ruined by monsters that simply scale up in might, you’ll definitely want to grab Ampersat” N/A – IND13 Games “It's a really cool little game, it's actually a really competent dungeon crawler...

You play as an Angel Soldier named (Your name here), you have an Angel Ghost named Lonra who's basically merged with you due to an experimental annoyance, and you have to find five keys to open a dumb gate in order to take down The Mauler--another experimental annoyance. Seems simple, right? Yeah, it could be a simple task....if it weren't for certain enemies hogging the keys to prevent your progression. You may have to fight some poetic orcs, evil wisps that try to gain sympathy, rats that are terrified of you, blobs and wasps that refuse to go back to Kroleum Labs, rhyming puppets pretending to be blobs, Your Evil Twin, a crazy scientist named Onyx Varrum who basically started this whole mess, and of course, The Mauler herself. Along the way, you'll meet some interesting characters like Tora Andren (a peppy, former circus knife-thrower turned honest thief), Nora Nomed (a sometimes no-nonsense Reaper Witch), and Nekrin Nomed (a somewhat gung-ho Reaper Soldier). You can even get Lonra's body back if you look in the right place. Becoming the Ultimate Demon is The Mauler's ultimate goal, so ultimately, you (and your new friends) have to stop her. Ultimately.

Put your destiny in the hands of three centuries-old vampires in this LGBTQ+ dark comedy visual novel. Play as Noe, a normal human, fanfic writer, and lover of all things supernatural with a distinct lack of self-preservation, as they take a chance and enter the strange house on Dead End Drive with the hope that the rumors they’ve heard about its inhabitants are true. There they find Laurel, Ilyas, and Valeria, and they quickly discover that there’s no escape, but not all endings are fatal. TREAD LIGHTLY , because there are over 25 ways to die in First Bite, and your journey to immortality won't be a smooth one. If you enjoyed What We Do In The Shadows but wanted it to be just a little bit gayer... this is the game for you. Please note that while the game is rated 18+ there is no full-frontal nudity if that's what you're here for. CHARACTERS Valeria Andrei (She/They) “All I’m thinking about is shredding your throat like barbecue, so talk fast.” She might be the youngest of our trio, but Valeria certainly believes she has the upper hand. But don't let her pretty face fool you, her bite is far worse than her bark. Though... both leave a pretty nasty sting. She's fucked Dracula, likes poetry, cheating at board games, internet shopping, and warm-blooded murder. Laurel Portman (He/They) 'Is there something I can do for you? Yes. Is there something I will do for you? Quite unlikely, but it's worth a shot.' Laurel is pushing 300 and is a lover of Hot Topic, insincerity, and watching their victims bleed out on the floor while they watch TV. He's also a seasoned connoisseur of the backhanded compliment and a force to be reckoned with. Tread lightly. Or not... Ilyas Al-Rai (He/Him) “Desperation makes your blood sweeter, so... beg.” Ilyas is the oldest but definitely not the wisest of the trio, coming in at a solid 2400 years old. Lover of athleisure, Eurodance, lifting weights, and thinking he's the smartest guy in the room. (Spoiler: he's not.) He's big, he's buff, and he's loveable as hell, but you don't want to be his prey.

You play as Regeria, a female lawyer who can use her powers of logic and reason to prove her clients innocent. It’s not all that straightforward though. Sometimes, you may find compelling reasons for throwing a case, forsaking the very defendant you are sworn to protect. These decisions will affect the outcome of the case and will have a ripple effect on later episodes of the series. The first trial has you defending a husband whose wife has been poisoned during the wedding reception. Currently you have the ability to prepare your witness, and interrupt other characters while they are speaking, but be careful, as you have a time limit to solve the case! KEY FEATURES: 5 episodes - Choices made in early episodes affect future cases. Don't like a character? You can throw them under the bus. Just be sure you're ready to watch them hang. New 'Witness Prep' Gameplay - Prep your witness to say whatever you want. Have them plead for mercy, or make them look like buffoons in front of the court to throw the case faster. New 'Fact Overload' Gameplay - Connect the facts together to bombard witnesses and force them to confess! You only get one shot though, so make it count! New 'Investigation' Gameplay - Short investigation sections which will affect the courtroom scenes. Play a board game and move Regeria to where she needs to be in time! New 'Convince the Jury' Gameplay - Be mindful of all your actions in court!

The game takes place in a fantasy world called 'Tianxiang'. Here, the person selected by God will be awarded the 'hand of God' to guide the power of the witch. You will play a mysterious role named 'Traveler'. In a free travel, you will meet with your own personality and unique ability to defeat the strong enemies with them and get back the loose relatives -at the same time, gradually discover ' The truth of the witch '. XX's literacy is very poor. I can get 500 gold copper coins every day every day 'Mikos Wish'.

Also. 000001, although I am only 1x, but I have surpassed the level of most people (including you). This is the proud capital given to me 'Mikos Wish'. It is no exaggeration to say that 'Mikos Wish' is the most magnificent and most ambitious work in MW Arts so far. Even after experiencing 8700 hours of hard fighting, there are many secrets that have not been discovered, the missing weapons and equipment, and spells and skills that have never been used. Although the combat experience in the game is not much different from what we have seen in a series of games before, various carefully designed enemies and BOSS battles in the game have raised the battle to a brand new level. Just like the Legend of Sye Oda a few years ago, 'Mikos Wish' is also a less excellent work that can not promote the development of similar games :) Introduction to the game · True This is a 'beautiful girl battle' game. In the game, your goal will be to defeat the beautiful girl who will defeat each level and unlock the corresponding rewards.

Soon you discover that your planet has been taken over by a giant evil spa cult. You have to find a way to escape through a space-time ganglion that can take you to various alien colonies throughout the universe. Your goal is to get to Earth where aliens are attempting to right the wrongs of humans by doing things such as forcing former billionaires to put together Ikea furniture for regular people. Among all the confusion of a recently colonized planet you hear of a kidnapped scientist who can help you find out what your name stands for. *** The game takes around one hour if you go through it at a regular pace. To do all the achievements maybe another hour or two. *** This game is more about having an experience and less about mechanics, strategy, high scores, etc. Might not be for everyone. *** It's pretty resource heavy.

Cut, thrust, block, and dodge your way through ten levels of intense, swordfighting action. Master your timing, point control, footwork, and peripheral awareness to stay alive. Use the floating mirrors to maintain a 360 degree field of view and never get caught off-guard. This game is highly active, be prepared for a workout! Story Some say the Willowisp is a mischievous fairy, some say a goblin, some the haunting spirit of a sinful human. It is known for its fiery nature and its tendency to lead travelers astray. Curious to see the Wisps for yourself, you ventured into the forest. You walked until the sky grew dark and a fog descended. You came across a pond and decided to rest. Then you saw a green light hovering over the water. Its luminance revealed a path of raised earth. The light beckoned you to follow, and so, carefully, you walked the path as it wound through the water. As you suspected, it was a trap! As had happened to so many travelers before, you had been lured astray by the strange light of the Willowisp to your doom. At least, that was what the Wisp intended. You had other plans. Unlike the others, you knew what would happen and came prepared. You were ready to fight the Wisps and make the forest safe... Additional Features Unlockable endless mode for open-ended challenge. Easy and Hard difficulty settings. Swap hands feature = lefty friendly!

1987860,Another Generic Space Shooter,"Jul 20, 2023",0 - 0,0,0,13.49,0,0,"Choose your ship and command it against an army pitted against you in this co-op wave-based arcade-style bullet hell space shooter. Fight for as long as you can with powerups acquired through the catalog, and blast through everything in your path. Progress The Waves Defeat waves of enemies that will grow in both numbers and strength as you advance through the armada. While playing, you might encounter a wave with some special rules. Make it far enough, and you'll find yourself at a boss wave. Make it even farther, and you'll find yourself fighting enemies with altered attacks and behaviors than what they had previously. Acquire Powerups While plowing through enemies, each one will have a chance to drop a powerup, a powerful item with extensive abilities that you can use. Fire a laser at enemies in your path, clear foes with a barrage of bees, or make your bullets hurt a little more with your favorite can of chunky soup. Some will grant temporary effects, some will fire projectiles, and some will grant permanent buffs for you or your allies. You can hold 2 at a time, so mix and match to what fits your playstyle. The Powerup Catalog The catalog has information on every powerup you have, with specific stats and descriptions so that you know in a moment's notice what each and every powerup does in your situation. While you only start with a few powerups available, you can purchase them from the powerup catalog and have them available for your future rounds. By completing waves, you earn arena tickets, which are spent on powerups to expand your arsenal. The better you play, the more you earn. Customize Your Runs The powerup catalog has the ability to enable or disable certain powerups, so you can customize your runs as much as you'd like. Want to run only your favorites? Go for it. Want to see how far you can get with a select few? Completely fine. Want to run the original five? The cops won't stop you. Feel free to use any modifiers as well, to give some extra spice or challenge to your runs.

I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many unicorns and wands as they could inside it. Now it’s your job to find them all! With 15 art pieces to choose from, and 1500+ hidden objects, you will have a lot of searching to do. Controls: Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a hidden object, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom. Difficulty: A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck. Get immersed: Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for everything.

Crystal Vibes is a VR music synesthesia demo that utilizes the cutting edge of spatial 3D audio and sound visualization that maps sound and light based on the science of the human senses, to push the frontiers of technology-mediated sensory experience in virtual reality. With the project's predecessor described as “transcendent” and “like traveling through a psychedelic kaleidoscope” (Forbes 2016), this piece ups the ante with music from producer Ott.

However, in this international city, big and small forces compete for interests, zero sum game, the red moon special zone surface prosperity behind the undercurrent surging, the protagonist knows that can not escape, can only make a choice.

Is it a choice to change fate, or to perish, or to muddle along? You will struggle between the major forces and your superiors, choose between past gratitude and resentment and reality, whether you will be reduced to someone else's pawn... Or change human history yourself... This will be your choice. How to play the game? The game revolves around the daily work and life of the players. You will start from the grass-roots staff and earn 'prestige' in the community to realize your own promotion step by step. Some open cultivation means, but the plot task is the core. This game can't be upgraded. It focuses on cultivation, dialogue and exploration. If you have played the bystander, disco, the world beyond and New Vegas, you can take it as a naive imitation. 'Chapter of midnight' is a small pixel RPG, which can't do the open world, excellent scenes and playing methods. It always tells stories in a simple and simple way. Let's take a look at the elements contained in this small RPG, * these elements will gradually open up with the game process: virtual world career In science and technology, there are certain elements of working day and night in the world of simulation. You can eat and sleep, you can rack your brains to seek a livelihood. You can work hard in the office, or you can travel around the city. You can concentrate on pushing the main line to pass customs, or you can explore everywhere to discover the hidden secrets. problem solving In the face of task problems, create a variety of solutions. Can be honest for NPC to complete the task, can be EQ persuasion, or in the back of the hand! In the mid-term, you may be dizzy because you can't use guns. If you stand in the wrong team, you may be chased by tanks and magic. You can also stealth, crack intelligence, and attack your opponent's weak points. How to get rich? Upgrade official rank, process products, sell, run businesses, even gamble, steal... Some of the worst activities, and then spend money on the blade - in exchange for good things, and even rebuild their own enterprises. cultivation and collection Four kinds of clothes with different effects, three kinds of long-range weapons, more than ten kinds of food, a few pets, five different homes, more than a dozen kinds of collections, technology and magic props with different uses, and 80 days of chattering about the background of the times... There are many new things worth collecting and exploring. thinking cabinet In a civilized society, the mind is the greatest weapon. Improving scientific skills and breaking through the world of black box technology can also improve humanistic quality and interpret the mind of others. Thought is the biggest weapon of the protagonist, and the game plot itself is full of sparks of various ideas collision in the imaginary 'ideological unification' society. However, thinking is a double-edged sword. In case of embarrassing things, the protagonist will be frustrated, physically and mentally exhausted and haunted by nightmares. If it is too 'smart' or even radical, it will be mistaken for cleverness. semi open plot The plot is the core of this work. There will be three main lines in the later stage, leading to the ending of three different ideological themes of three different forces. There are 11 characters with different standpoints in the chapter of Midnight: scholar, magician, agent, officer and leader. Each of them has his own destiny. There are six chapters in the game. Your different choices in each chapter will leave traces, which will eventually be reflected in 2000 kinds of patchwork ending combinations. The story of the game revolves around the aerial world. There are many angles of the story. The second week program adds more profound content on the basis of the first week. There are 21 achievements in the game. Can't you achieve all the achievements in one week? In the second week, you can turn on the God mode, and the rhythm is greatly accelerated, so that you can quickly experience other plots / win achievements. fantasy before us, reality behind us The plot of the chapter of midnight is a blend of the real world and the fantasy world. The plot and characterization are heavy in my hands - it takes a lot of my mind. But this work has left a lot of free space for players, not only the freedom of the plot, but also the freedom of playing. Players can take the leisure stream, skip all the plot clearance, or they can think deeply and make a perfect ending. Maybe it's perfect or not at all. The process of the game is about nine to twelve hours. The amount of words is a little large, but the scenes and dialogues are not cumbersome, and they are not procrastinating. However, the amount of information needs to be calm and play slowly. Please be calm. The future of midnights This is not a big game, but it can reflect a complex topic. After the game is over, there will still be a lot of stories to go into. This is why the launch is delayed. Few people express themselves and eternity at the same time, but everyone is willing to devote their efforts to polish their stories and tell them to others on the screen.",['Simplified Chinese'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/header.jpg?t=1656520886,https://space.bilibili.com/14413744 Q群：1026745893,https://space.bilibili.com/14413744,,True,False,False,0,,0,209,5,,21,181,,0,0,0,0,银阼,Electronic Sheep Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Story Rich,Choices Matter,Multiple Endings,JRPG,Sci-fi,Female Protagonist,RPG,Lore-Rich,Politics,Pixel Graphics,RPGMaker,Dystopian,Capitalism,Cold War,Singleplayer,Adventure,Philosophical,Alternate History,Puzzle,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_ce7d35bee8305d9fae10aa1ef2f41fa30bd6f0c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_9be8fa61cb379b5e5a5475daab29708ac1c99708.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_06416769cc44506da83c93c2785bd0c150520769.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_d331646e2c87bb6abec6afa9441174ebcbe26047.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_7130a55eb76e565b5462c47ad1424d8cfda03b8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_3cbbab459d924ce33c69038efca53a7c07277ecd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_046433cb521059503ba06e849210ddf0591f784e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_cdc02624f0abc2df6c056e0677cfbba7f1d1ffaf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_7d9f815ef2cd802125d057a482fe1f2e9bb9b82b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_6f09d760113cc3812b7917434f65f8b3e1b01711.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_7d87cf52bdbfee5917e7a96e90ca865007fe3df4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_c2e679df831d2aefdb4e57d4703e23892f355871.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_482115ae0ebbd6e8379cb2252f55e2587ffebe96.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_e144da91a749366b3918cd17facd86cb2c9961b6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_001482ed387d14903d5945b6a148e42e23634741.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_01e9266892b7b98afd6e54c31eeb1e749c586e01.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_375029cbcaa3724acef736a2f15a6c91a96b3e14.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209770/ss_ba3c6ed7c1445cca966d436fc0195715d712a69c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656520886",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256824735/movie_max.mp4?t=1614959082

622010,The Fall of Lazarus,"Oct 4, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,11.99,0,1,"You are a crew member of the USSC Lazarus waking up from cryo sleep without memories and even without name in an apparently abandoned drifting cargo spaceship. But you’re not alone, there is also Hybris, the Artificial intelligence who commands the ship. Who are you? What are you doing there? What is the Black Cube? The Truth Is Darker Than Space. WELCOME TO THE USSC LAZARUS The game takes place aboard the USSC Lazarus (Unified Space Ship Companies), a ship that belongs to KR Corporation (Kross-Rübel), a company dedicated to the interstellar transport of goods and with close ties to the mining industry. The player takes on the role of the protagonist, a veteran of the Venusian wars looking to carve out a new future for herself. She has enlisted to participate in an nine-year mission to work on a mining colony. When she wakes up from hypersleep she finds herself alone on the ship and with no memories. The player must then explore, investigate and find a way to get off the ship before the situation gets worse. Along the way, the protagonist will experience a series of traumatic events related to his personal life: visions, dreamlike recollections, strange noises and apparitions that mess with his head and make her question what is real and what is not. We have a script with a main plot and a linear emotive journey waiting for you, but this is just the beginning. If you go deep and investigate you'll see there ir more beneath the surface. Once you've played the first scenes of the game you'll be able of wandering the full ship, searching and exploring every single detail. The mystery of what is happening is the basis of the Lazarus gameplay, although the player is the one who gathers all the clues and details scattered throughout the ship to reach the conclusion. FEATURES · INMERSIVE STORYTELLING FULL OF MYSTERIES to unveil in a science fiction set up with a multi-level funcional script. · UNCOMPRESSED NARRATIVE where there is more than meets the eye and every detail is there for a reason. · A bunch of DIVERSE PUZZLES to solve.

1083800,Glitch Arena,"Jun 1, 2019",0 - 20000,0,0,0.0,0,0,"Glitch, a fast and minimal arena first person shooter. Influenced by Quake and Unreal Tournament, Glitch is a classic old school shooter designed to encapsulate what makes AFPS great, and leave out what doesn't. Gamemodes include duel, DM, TDM, Hoonymode and the new CTB (capture the balls, an evolution of CTF). The focus is on gameplay and content instead of high fidelity details. Movement is non-linear, with an initial flick-dodge, step jumping (aka double jumping) and speed building via 'glitching'™. Air control is medium-high and autojumping is a thing. Weapons are the 'holy trinity' plus a shotgun starting weapon, and the ability to combo a rocket with rail. Maps are iconic archetypes of the genre. Hitsounds and hitmarkers on the way. Learn the game with HUD item timers. Is this a dead game? Of course it's a dead game! It was designed to by played by 2-4 people: you and a friend or three. If you are looking for games with random people on the internet, this is not for you. You don't need a thousand concurrent players for a good time.

1892470,王子斗恶龙(The prince fights the Dragon),"Mar 6, 2022",0 - 20000,0,0,0.99,0,0,"This is a game of the prince fighting the dragon. In order to save the refugees, the prince of the King City picked up his weapons and bravely went to the Dragon Cave to fight the Dragon death. The prince knocked down countless demons with the magic given to him by the spirit of the earth. The people forged weapons for him to make him add bricks and tiles. The people gave him strength to make him not afraid to move forward. What did the prince do for the people of the Kingdom and the dragon. We come to the world of the King City, where the prince grew up. Modern people have a fast pace. We immerse ourselves in a new world and experience new feelings. I set the people here very well, like heaven. In this new world, we can fight against demons, make profits and give money a role. They will happily give us what we want. The reason why the hero is a prince is that we want to be noble people. When the prince plays in this world, he will see many interesting things. As for why I made this game, I hope players can answer it by themselves. If you insist on knowing the content, I can tell you sincerely. First of all, this is an adventure game. I built a kingdom continent to adventure here. The kingdom is divided into two floors, between the royal palaces and the hall. The kingdom is full of soldiers and ministers. The place here is very wide. You can talk to them and get any information. After talking with them, you can enter the main line. The whole continent is divided into three parts. They are the starting place of the game in the middle, the western town, and the last military important place. Each map has corresponding supplies. We have made full logistical support in the town. Here you can buy weapons, armor, sundries and blood return. This is a system for fighting monsters. Buy props according to the basic value, and the prince's power will change. Because of the strange play in the game. We require the game to be divided into four props to change the basic value: combat weapon, armor, armor and helmet. Monster the whole game is divided into three kinds, each has its own merits. His ability can change himself or herself. We can specify different playing methods for monsters. You can use purchased weapons and rich spell system in battle, which is tailored for the prince. A rich spell system can take the game to a higher level. This is rare. We have greatly improved the defect that turn based games can only attack. Give players more room to fight. Magic can diversify the attack, change its ability value like the other party, and stabilize HP. The game is pushed through the keyboard. The plot is very simple, but it is definitely different. I can also find precious items through map exploration. You can buy blood returning medicine in the town.

1230930,Inside The Computer,"Mar 4, 2020",0 - 20000,0,0,0.0,0,0,"Plot: You were a computer science professor. Once you wanted to test your new invention, the 'Real Object Teleporting Portal Based on Network'. This special machine could digitalizes a real object and send it to network wires by a connected computer, then transport it through network wires to the target portal and instantiate it to the real world. After some simple testing by small objects, you were ready to test it using your own body. You entered the input portal. But you didn't know that there were some viruses in the computer connected to the portal. The viruses hacked your transport program and blocked you from getting into the network wires after you were successfully digitalized. You stayed in the bus of your computer. (Bus: a special kind of circuit which connects different parts in a computer and transfers data between them.) The viruses blocked the output portal behind you, so you couldn't get out. You knew that if you go to each hardware in the computer to delete these loaded viruses, you could unblock the portal then go back to human world safety. -~-~-~-~-~-I'm the deluxe split line -~-~-~-~-~- How to play? This game has 12 levels now. They are 3 disk levels, 8 RAM levels, and one CPU level. In disk levels, the viruses come recurrently. You need to delete all of them with only one life to win. Be careful with the magnetic read head that could illuminate a dangerous red beam above you. In the first four levels of RAM levels, there are 3 virus spawners that can spawn viruses. You need to delete all spawners first, then delete all viruses to win. But because of the hacking of viruses, the bridges in RAM levels will recurrently collapse and rebuild. If you are careless, you may fall into the void then be deleted directly. But don't worry, this time you have 2 extra recompile (revive) chances to help you win. In the next four levels of RAM levels, there are 8 virus spawners and a ringlike barrier in the scene. There's also a Code Fragment in the center of the scene. The player can not go or transmit across the barrier. There are four virus spawners inside the barrier and four virus spawners outside the barrier. The player's start point is inside the barrier, and the barrier will break itself after the player deletes the four virus spawners inside the barrier. After the barrier breaks, the player can go and delete the four virus spawners outside the barrier. The bridges will still recurrently collapse and rebuild. After you delete all of the four virus spawners, the Code Fragment in the center of the scene will be invoked, and the bridges will stop collapsing. The Code Fragment is a mini-boss. It can only attack the player and be harmed by the player after it's invoked, and it has different skills. The player will win the level after the Code Fragment is deleted. In the CPU level, the player will fight with the virus boss. This level has four main stages, and the player will fight with the boss in different states and amounts in different stages. In the first stage, the player will fight with Advanced Virus Boss Image. In the second stage, the player will fight with Virus Boss Instance, and the third stage begins after Virus Boss Instance's completeness is less or equal to 75% of its full completeness value. In the third stage, the player will fight with four Virus Boss Image at the same time. In the fourth stage, the player will continue to fight with Virus Boss Instance until the player deletes the boss. The player needs to survive through all of the stages and delete Virus Boss Instance to win this level. There are four Buff Sphere Generators in the scene, and they can generate Buff Spheres over time. The player will receive a random buff and recover some bullets instantly after picking up a Buff Sphere. The player will also receive some debuffs when being harmed by some of the boss's skills. This game has 3 different types of viruses. The first kind is the basic ranged attack virus, the second kind is the ranged attack virus with shield, and the third kind is the close attack virus. The player has three special abilities besides the basic attack. The first one is shooting a blast bullet that can hurt all viruses in an area. The second one is creating a temporary shield that can help you immunize all damages (except falling into the void). And the third one is Transmission, the player can only use this skill in RAM levels and CPU level. After a short time for preparation, it can help you get to a destination away from you inside a given maximum distance. This ability can be used to get out of viruses' encirclement or pass a gap that is less than the maximum distance. But it can't help you go through a wall or any other obstacles. This skill has two levels, you can only use level 1 transmission in the first four levels of RAM levels. But you can use level 1 or level 2 transmission in the next four RAM levels and the CPU level. Comparing with the level 1 transmission, the level 2 transmission has a larger maximum distance (You need to use your mouse scroll wheel to adjust the distance to the new maximum distance manually after the level 2 transmission is ready.), but it also requires extra preparation time.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/header.jpg?t=1615131274,,,larrywang2020@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,17,0,,4,0,,0,0,0,0,Zihan Wang,Zihan Wang,"Single-player,Partial Controller Support","Free to Play,Indie","Free to Play,Indie,Sci-fi,Singleplayer,PvE","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_2bbb95c31586670204b46ab1b54b41be7251f8c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_968e16faed78967ae1181afa664ae8d5622d5fac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_1c8e60522a45ba668f2366febb548ac66881995d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_abeb0217fbf441d29654dc2f1e5b50681c927628.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_d354d5413e2f581418182778445e262bc7301306.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_00ce9fff3709048f5d455885b4487e7c69e1c445.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_dce92e03d5d374ec42c430eec0119188e7d0f10d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_e23b6e3026d0f91309f6c7fbc5b8e43d46586ed4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_f7eb94a769f5f12381dc0fc48d9f5b7e4169ec44.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_b1c4808e5513b84506ef2db35aa39755b75d516f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_f0ecf04ef000d51e01fca78081679de2605e439a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1230930/ss_6f97fe6540618cebd9eb657a1e189617a7ef3219.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615131274",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256824034/movie_max.mp4?t=1614445036

In AlCHeMoS, you'll pilot a Proto-Atomic Shell - an atomic-sized device capable of collecting and combining subatomic particles - to discover the elements. KNOWLEGDE IS POWER Science is under threat from mysterious Dark Forces which have attacked our Elemental Archives, and only you can help! As a Proto-Atomic Shell Operator, your task will be to explore experimental environments to collect and combine protons, neutrons and electrons in order to rebuild the Elemental Archives. ENTER THE ATOMIC WORLD From your laboratory bench overlooking the Experimental Hutch, you'll remotely control the Proto-Atomic Shell after it is safely transported (via sample-changing robot) to the selected level. The action in AlCHeMoS takes place on molecular worlds: each level environment is created from real-world protein structure data. You will start at one end of the protein chain, and after gathering the required particles for the level, you must make your way to the other end of the protein chain for safe extraction of your Proto-Atomic Shell. DARK MATTER You'll need to keep your wits about you as you progress through each level. The forces of Dark Matter which attacked the Elemental Archives will evolve as you proceed, providing you with ever-increasing challenges. Beware undergoing Fusion with Dark Atoms as they develop more and more sophisticated methods of interrupting your progress! POWERFUL ABILITIES As you discover the elements, you'll unlock a variety of powerful atomic abilities for your Proto-Atomic Shell. Boost your movement abilities with jump, dash and quantum tunnel modules; take control of particles with a Beta unit to let you interchange between protons and neutrons; take the fight back to Dark Matter with an enemy-freezing gamma-ray emitter and the all-powerful Annihilator. FELXIBLE UPGRADES Pick the right tool for the job with fully-reconfigurable upgrades. Gain Quarks by completing side-objectives and use these Quarks to purchase upgrades for your Proto-Atomic Shell. Boost your speed and movement abilities; improve your energy regeneration and efficiency; gain resistance to radioactivity and much more. Upgrades can be freely reconfigured at any time from the main menu. CHALLENGE YOUR FRIENDS After beating your best time for a fully-complete level, why not challenge your steam friends to beat it? Steam-friends leaderboards are available for each level in the main menu! RAYMARCHED ENVIRONMENTS The atoms in AlCHeMoS are all rendered by completely custom raymarching: smoothly joined surfaces with no edges or vertices; reflections; volumetric fog; soft shadows; dynamic lighting; all this and more awaits you! Raytracing hardware is not required, though 4GB or more of video RAM is strongly recommended. IMMERSIVE DYNAMIC MUSIC AND SOUNDS AlCHeMoS features a dynamic sound track, with music that seamlessly reacts to the game state, and sound effects that stay in tune with the music! CUSTOMIZE YOUR LABORATORY WORKBENCH No Lab bench should be without an interactive ornament to keep you entertained while your experiment is running! Unlock a variety of pieces to take pride of place on your lab bench shelf, such as a 3-mode Lab Timer, a dynamically music-tuned service bell, an Albert Einstein Bobblehead, and more! GET INVOLVED Hooting Banana Studios is a solo-developer and AlCHeMoS is my first project. I'd love to hear from you!

The Vampire Regent is a 460,000-word interactive dark fantasy novel by Morton Newberry and Lucas Zaper, where occult political disputes and clashing loyalties tell the twisted story of a town designed for deceit. Manipulate the mayor so her projects align with your interests. Use high crime rates to conceal the activities of your kind, or suppress them to maintain an unsuspecting façade of order. Provide nourishment and safety for the vampires under your rule while trying to preserve the secret of their existence, and face the enemies that threaten it. Drink blood at nightclubs and listen to rumors and tragedies—or make some of your own. Practice the centuries-old tradition of fencing and put your skills to the test. Quench your thirst for blood, power, or knowledge, and even find love… if such a thing is possible for a non-beating heart. Play as male or female, and explore your sexuality beyond mortal conventions.

Fight vampire hunters, criminals, and others of your kind—or manipulate them toward your goals. Unearth buried secrets about the world, the people around you, and even yourself.

These two can grant you an enormous edge over the hordes of enemies you'll face, since not only can you slice enemies in gory fashion, you can use these tools to set off traps found in the levels. Kick a pile of barrels on a batch of knights charging towards you, or cut a rope to unleash logs rolling on your foes, crushing them... and much more. You will need clever timing and sharp senses, since your enemies number in the hundreds, if not thousands. The snowy plains will color red... THE WORLD NEEDS HEROES Lalli offers an original story, loosely based on a Finnish folk tale. To enhance the experience, the cutscenes are all voiceacted, but only subtitled in English... since they are voice-acted in Finnish!

At the beginning of the century, the island state of Cambridia was a densely populated, vibrant, wealthy state. It seemed that soon a golden age would come for Cambridia. How could it happen that only twenty years later this very Cambridia would be fragmented, that its elite was divided into warring parties, that the townspeople rebelled, that its people languished under an unbearable burden of taxes, that provinces fell one after another, that gangs of mercenaries they gave away the country to the flow and plunder, that the people openly laughed at the government, that money depreciated, commerce was paralyzed and poverty reigned everywhere, no one knew what tomorrow would bring him. Why did this state collapse? Mediocrity! The mediocrity of its president, ministers and officials, their stupid vanity, their frivolity in state affairs, their inability to surround themselves with the right people, their carelessness, arrogance, inability to hatch great plans or even follow those that were borne before them. Everything perishes when stupid people are at the head of the state. On the ruins of greatness, unity disintegrates.' The country is engulfed in civil war, chaos reigns everywhere, parties are at war with each other, gangs of marauders are devastating settlements.

2239200,Animal Across: Afrika,"Mar 10, 2023",0 - 0,0,0,0.99,0,0,"WELCOME TO AFRIKA!! With an indie and artsy visual, Animal Across: Afrika promises to be a light and fun game, set in Africa with endemic animals from there. The game is set up similar to Tetris, where pieces are falling and you have to match them in order to eliminate them. The differences are that here the pieces always come in sets of two horizontal blocks and, in addition to the colors, they match the animal with its food. In this game there is no time to complete the puzzle, only the score matters. This game features five gameplay modes between singleplayer and local multiplayer: - Singleplayer: In this mode you play by your own, trying to eliminate the pieces through combinations. If the board is full, you lose. - Multiplayer 1: This mode is perfect for spending time with a friend. A clash in which each player has their board and both receive the same pieces and need to allocate them. There's only one winner here! - Multiplayer 2: Here, everyone also has their board and only one wins, the difference is that each player gets their own pieces, in other words, they are different pieces. - Multiplayer V: In this mode, both players have the same board, which is presented in a V format, but each one has their own side. You must use the best strategies to beat your opponent, and you can even play pieces on your opponent's side to harm him and get away with it. - Multiplayer Co-op: For those who want to play with a friend, but don't like competition, we have that option too! In this mode there is only one board, a bigger one, where your partner and you must help each other to win the game. Features: 5 modes of gameplay. Singleplayer and local multiplayer. Play in beautiful environments of Africa! Originally composed soundtracks. A puzzle game focused on fun, alone or with a friend.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2239200/header.jpg?t=1678461899,,,beardedrabbitstudio@gmaiil.com,True,False,False,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Bearded Rabbit Game Studio,Bearded Rabbit Game Studio,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen","Casual,Indie",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2239200/ss_ae847e930edc57bc0bb2826775e5a583c3874feb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678461899,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2239200/ss_50378598f6d7fa5d0e9b470a90d5a2b28fec2544.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678461899,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2239200/ss_93094d82a1604b102087b171d381dd0eb30bb9e6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678461899,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2239200/ss_a93d9cd2e41293f89f733f5591a0d0398294780a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678461899,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2239200/ss_8da199fe6ebdb73d6ad7ca26e763a78cffe78f2e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678461899,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2239200/ss_cf86fd27c4af14c234f7cd48cc8e97137a48b010.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678461899,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2239200/ss_665977e903bad6fe96a630bfa3bde442d2f122f2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678461899,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2239200/ss_0e07eb1936cdc78df953992fcb32b5bdcf2239b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678461899",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256933313/movie_max.mp4?t=1677691867

Dive through the depths of various dungeons, clearing them out of any baddies that plague their chambers, while also collecting shiny coins and fantastical weapons along the way. OtterQuest is an old-school rogue-lite action RPG, reminiscent of some of the earlier Zelda titles and their respective dungeons. With each level of the dungeon cleared, you'll face up against more difficult obstacles, challenges, and enemies. Of course, with great risk comes great reward - collect SandDollars from your surroundings to spend on character upgrades and heals, find powerful weapons to increase your chances of survival, and unlock whimsical characters to play as on your next run through the dungeon. OtterQuest differs from your usual gameplay of button spamming your attacks - your attacks are instead skill-dependant, based on the movements of your mouse. With precision-designed hitboxes, the business end of each weapon will do actual damage to your enemies - it's not just a fancy animation. As time goes on, we plan on adding more dungeons, enemies, characters, weapons, and items - each either hand-designed by our team or hand-selected by the community's submissions, turning OtterQuest into a larger community-developed experience over time.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1857220/header.jpg?t=1643589081,,https://arkadiagalactic.com,,True,False,False,0,,0,2,0,,5,0,,0,0,0,0,Arkadia Galactic,Arkadia Galactic,"Single-player,Steam Achievements","Adventure,Indie","Adventure,RPG,Action RPG,Action-Adventure,Dungeon Crawler,2D,Pixel Graphics,Top-Down,Fantasy,Old School,Retro,Combat,Hack and Slash,Linear,Singleplayer,Indie,Action Roguelike,Rogue-lite,Rogue-like","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1857220/ss_6015adc181053ddcd4f64f604521037bf075716b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643589081,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1857220/ss_93f0fe42872ca4bf119e523f3ae4b2b9d14b925b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643589081,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1857220/ss_bd8bd59536e903cc193fe8d1bed42b8cd30c83b6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643589081,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1857220/ss_0dc46a372db0e16013a56f887f54c7a5ad560254.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643589081,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1857220/ss_b0670a6066f875e6fff14716c1dfee09653c3925.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643589081",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256866420/movie_max.mp4?t=1640879667

Control a team of six goofy characters, and fight your way through teams of enemies and save Atruian from evil forces, while having a good laugh. The story does not take itself seriously and aims to make fun of the DnD and RPG genres. If you enjoy turn-based RPGs, and like strategy-based battles where levels are gained through completing specific tasks and quests, then you will enjoy this game. - Fully 3D maps and dynamic scenes - Charming, funny and large cast of characters - Charge-turn battle system - Useful skills and strategy based battles - ~6 Hours of gameplay, ~20 hours for 100% completion - New Game + - Many Side quests - Multiple Endings and a Secret Ending The war between The Cyrene League and The Barcanid Empire has been raging on for some time now, and the tension has reached a breaking point. Recently, The Barcanid Empire hired the talents of the evil duo: The Chronomancer who has the power to control time, and The Black Knight who can defeat entire troops with one blow. In order to combat the Barcanids, The Cyrene League has procured our heroes to even the odds. With our new heroes at the helm, The Cyrene League comes up with a plan to end the war once and for all, in one final battle in The Cleaved Fields. The game is a short RPG that loosely mimics Dungeons &amp; Dragons mechanics, where you choose your leader of a 6 character party, each with their own unique ending. Levels are not gained through battle experience, but only by completing certain events in the story.

The charming villagers of Eloria welcome you into their peaceful lives, but you soon find there’s trouble brewing. Now your friends need your help. A powerful magic infects the rivers and forests, monsters overrun the old mines, and the once-bustling Blue Oak Library lies in ruins. Who owns the library? You find yourself tangled in a tale of forbidden magic, ancient secrets, and a quest to unite Eloria when Queen Isa and the intrepid entrepreneur Alonzo clash over this very question. Of course, you can give it all up for a simple life on your farm. Grow crops, tend to livestock, and forage and fish across the island. Everything you make on your farm and discover on the island can be sold, brewed in potions, gifted to friends, donated to the library, or used to upgrade your weapons and tools. Use your profits to customise your character, expand your farm, and care for your livestock and pets. There are over 30 characters, each with unique stories, and 15 romanceables to date, fall in love with and marry. Features  Crops Grow over 40 types of crops, including a variety of seeds, flowers, fruits, fantasy crops and vegetables that vary with the seasons. Donate your harvest to the Plantlife and Wildlife Compendiums in the library. Perhaps you’d prefer to take your time to convert your crops into pickles, jams, juices and wines. Of course, you can always sell or gift whatever you grow to your friends. Farm Animals Buy chicks, calves, lambs and piglets from Cedric and nurture them into adult livestock. Be sure to take good care of your livestock and pet them often. The better you treat your animals, the better products they produce. Add special produce to your harvest by raising fantasy animals from Elorian myths, such as the Gokey Crab, Rose-Nosed Eakey and Oakipine. Adopt a pet to follow you on your journey and keep you company on your farm, even when you’re planting potatoes. Choose from dogs, cats or the Elorian fennec fox. Potions &amp; Fantasy Find Hazel, the witch in the forest, to uncover the secrets of the Great Witches of Eloria and brew potions. Potions have unique gameplay effects, such as teleportation, replenishing your health and influencing the weather to alter your farm. Inspired by our favorite fantasy tales, we have filled Blue Oak Bridge with rich and exciting lore full of magical mysteries and ancient myths. Character Customization Embrace your creativity and dress how you wish! Visit the local tailor and barber to take your pick of a wide range of costumes, accessories and hairstyles. Perhaps you’ll wear a pocket watch or a don Panama hat. Many characters have special costumes to unlock and show off new friendships with style, such as the chicken outfit, Welsh Dragon costume and Princess Nandi’s ballroom gown. Farm Customization Decorate your farmhouse down to the last detail—from door to roof to siding! For a picture-perfect farm, visit Enzo the carpenter to build barns and silos. Whether you create a practical farm or a cozy croft, it’s always best to be creative. Gather resources and collect recipes to craft new items and decorations. You can craft brewing stations to brew teas and coffees, bee houses to make honeys or convertors to make wines, jams and cheeses. Use your converters to produce more profitable products, taking you one step closer to building your dream farm. Elorians Make friends with over 30 characters! Give them gifts and complete unique quests to see their stories. Will you uncover their deepest, darkest secrets along the way? There’s only one way to find out… 11 romanceables are waiting for that special someone to go on dates and fall in love.

At the center of it all stands the Ancient Blue Oak in the library.  Tools, Mining, Ores Dig deep into the Elorian mines with your trusty tools to gather copper, iron, gold and obsidian. Use your ores for crafting, quests or to smelt into lucrative ingots. You should also visit Marcelo and use ores to upgrade your tools if you wish to explore the deeper levels of the mines. The deeper you delve, the more ores you’ll find. But be careful, legend has it the mines are home to countless ancient monsters. Combat There are many dangerous monsters in the mines of Eloria. The further you delve, the more you’ll need to study their behaviors to defeat them and earn monster drops. Choose your perfect sword, axe or bow and master the three combat styles: one-handed, two-handed and ranged.

The moon in Shangri-La is quietly shifting from full to full, endlessly. As a result, the inhabitants' spirits are in a state of flux. They believe that the young girl is the one called Liars Moon who can save the world, but ...' Introduction Liars Moon Shangri-La is a visual novel game.

Characters Fenrir Voiced by Tatsuhisa Suzuki 'He was the eldest of three brothers and was known as the Calamity Brother. He is a member of the Lantern Wolves, which is the security team belong to the city. Although he has a tough and brash attitude, he is essentially a hard-working, gentle man. He has ambitions to change the world because of something that happened in the past. He is often tricked by his younger brothers.' Jorm Voiced by Shimono Hiro 'He was the second of three brothers and was known as the Calamity Brother. His rich expressions make him easy to relate to, so few people guess his age correctly. Although he belongs to the Lantern Wolves, his work and usual attitude is very perfunctory. He is completely unaware of his outbursts and often leaves his brothers feeling helpless.' Hel Voiced by Namikawa Daisuke 'He was the third of the brothers and was known as the Calamity Brother. He has only entered the Lantern Wolves for a short time, but is already appreciated for his cool head and knowledge. The nobles were very fond of his looks, so he established good relations with them despite being an ominous child.' Hati Voiced by Saito Soma 'A noble young man with a gentle nature and a good heart. He did not like to keep up the aristocratic façade, so he spoke and acted no differently from ordinary people. He lost his memory at an early age and lived on the streets, but was fortunate enough to be picked up by Ende and adopted as a foster brother.' Ende Voiced by Sugita Tomokazu 'A powerful nobleman in Shangri-La. Not only did he adopt Hati, who was living on the streets and had lost his memory, but he also had no qualms about keeping in touch with the Calamity Brothers, whom the other nobles feared to avoid. As a result, he was treated as an eccentric by others.' How to advance the story 'The story consists of two parts, a prologue and a character selection branch. Once you have cleared the character route, you can receive CGs, mini-stories, audio introductions and a memory gallery section depending on the ending. There are only 4 character routes available in the first stage, and a fifth character route will be opened once all of them have been cleared. Once the fifth character line has been cleared, the Liars Moon section will open and players will be able to read the story of the world.'

In the Ultimate Fishing Simulator the fish are biting like crazy. We guarantee that you’ll never fall asleep. Ultimate Fishing Simulator is a comprehensive fishing simulator which allows using various techniques, in different places around the world and most importantly, you don’t need a permanent connection to the Internet for it. If you are bored of waiting for fish to take and falling asleep in front of the computer, this means that you have played a bad game! In the Ultimate Fishing Simulator this will never happen. Select the appropriate equipment and bait, cast your line and wait for a bite. Success is guaranteed. In addition to traditional fishing techniques, in Ultimate Fishing Simulator you’ll also find a winter map where you will be able to go ice fishing! Buy an auger at the store, find a suitable location and drill an airhole. But not too small, so that you can remove the fish. There are two modes of difficulties in the Ultimate Fishing Simulator, thanks to which there is something for everyone. Normal Mode allows you to enjoy the game in all its glory. In normal mode, all the features in the game are included. Realistic Mode requires more patience and efficiency from the player. Fish will be biting less and will fight longer. Some of the game features in this mode are disabled, such as the underwater camera. Every fisherman likes to admire his trophies. Some release their fish, other stuff and hang them on their walls. In Ultimate Fishing Simulator you can exactly do the same! Decide yourself what you want to do with the fish you catch. Sell? Release? Stuff? The choice is yours. If the maps available in the game bore you, you can create your own. Be creative and build your own dream fishery that you can share other players thanks to the built-in level editor. Enjoy fishing with your friends on your favorite, family fishery. What more could you ask for? Everybody likes to use brand-name equipment, which very often differentiates from the competition with its parameters and appearance. We are the only fishing game that has a license for SAKURA equipment (SERT S.A.S.). You will find in our game their rods, reels, baits and lines. Each item has been mapped in detail and added to the game. * connection to the Internet is required to play the game in multiplayer mode.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Russian', 'Turkish']","['English', 'Turkish']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/header.jpg?t=1658124146,https://ultimate-fishing.com/,,help@ultimate-games.com,True,False,False,0,,0,396,76,,125,448,,297,0,427,0,Bit Golem,Ultimate Games S.A.,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Casual,Indie,Simulation,Sports","Fishing,Simulation,Multiplayer,Sports,Co-op,Relaxing,Realistic,First-Person,Massively Multiplayer,Open World,Early Access,Singleplayer,Online Co-Op,Family Friendly,Casual,Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_90ce4e2f4f7c4cf0dfe518dc9e4896fb1ce93189.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_ad11582e06e57ca6c7ec5ca890cd85f53fe8cefe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_2b7c0285b7e0035228cea2ce2126a36c2b890f4d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_e5641b079b0b69360d818d0fdd2ef7fcef958746.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_a0fefe0df092f11a1bd956f012a6a85bf72cccb0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_e8a0091bde9e5a35f8b12ba507c8b96a3af3d82a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_3b60ab05a2110014405f7ffae44380cc6953291c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_36ceb82ef47f1514e0d43061370c1eaca9661344.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_0283748dea61b570ed721606789886a69cecca56.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_c4ebf27586f464538edaa1f6519b6e8259075c84.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_13469b522cf079e16d7359873c323aa130e5e8d3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_31b226c128cd9f743ed47dfc7c870e91f0378a7a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_e788d3126eb4fecda09974a50d7ad63d976e0a9e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_701593506b8c79cc513d0d51a610150a590a27d4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1024010/ss_26ec7c72ecf7e44a278932307a31ce7ed5d673c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658124146",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256742210/movie_max.mp4?t=1549483028

Spice Road is a town building, social and economic simulation game full of original challenges. 'Deep in the mountains and deserts of central Asia, where life is hard and death is sudden, thin trails of gold, silk and spice trace a web between the industrial forges of the West and the exotic climes of the East.' You are a colonial governor in the 18th Century, building a town on the Spice Road in a time of war and discovery. More than spice travels your roads – musket armies, philosophies, and power plays that span the globe are at your control. From palace to monastry, trade post to smugglers den – your town is worthless without the nobles, monks, merchants and rogues that chose to live in it – and keeping them all happy at the same time is never simple. Spice Road uses the StormRaid™ engine to deliver a beautiful fully 3D rendered world on high-end DirectX® graphics cards. Features: Advanced economic and trading simulation. 3 tiers of industry provide goods and services for populations of citizens, slaves and nobles with full control over wages and taxation. Build a network of farms, mines and caravan routes. Scout the map to find rare and exotic goods to export to distant lands. Defeat Bandit raiders, or pay them tribute to keep your routes peaceful. Compete against cunning corporate rivals. Choose diplomacy or raid their caravans and wage war on their cities. Meet your citizen's social and religious needs. Attract visiting explorers or pilgrims by developing the entertainment or spiritual side of your town. 20 Campaign Missions + generate new maps in Sandbox mode. Player Comments: 'I think it's genuinely fantastic. I play many strategy games, and it's hard to find a mid-level title that is as solid as Spice Road in terms of gameplay.' - Colin 'This must be one of the best indie titles I've ever played.

Embodying Darth Vader and “altering the deal”, or stepping into Jack Sparrow’s boots and drunkenly slurring “where’s the rum?!” Innovative entertainment means taking mediums we know and love and taking a new perspective. Another main inspiration was Ernest Cline’s “Ready Player One”. In the story, when an OASIS avatar begins a FlickSync game, they become a specific character from a movie and have to recite lines of dialogue. When the avatar speaks, they will speak in the voice of the specific character, move around as the character, see, hear, and feel anything the character would see, hear, and feel in the movie. Players can take on the roles of their favorite story characters, acting out scenes and speaking the lines of their assigned character. They enter into the Tea Party scene from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and become Alice, the Mad Hatter, or the March Hare. They can also play the scenes with their friends, with each person being assigned different characters using their own Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Windows MR headsets. During the scenes, when a character needs to speak, a cue card shows the user the lines assigned to them. They have to speak the lines correctly within an assigned period of time. Players are scored by how well they speak their lines of dialogue.

1293460,Ash of Gods: The Way,"Apr 27, 2023",20000 - 50000,458,0,22.49,0,3,"Build winning decks of warriors, equipment, and spells from four different factions in this story-driven tactical card combat game. Battle your way through a series of major tournaments, each with their own opponents, battlefields, and even rules. Earn new cards and upgrade your favorites, then combine them into any number of decks: you’re free to experiment as much as you like! Do prepare carefully for key battles with major characters: you’ll only get a few chances before defeat will change the course of the story, though the game continues… All the while you will meet new characters, have conversations, and make decisions that will affect the fate of the entire world. You play as Finn, a young man whose only hope of preventing a neighboring nation from attacking his home is to master the card game they use to teach aristocrats the art of warfare: the Way. Infiltrate the tournaments they hold, and you can get close to their elite commanders. What you do once you get there will be up to you. Just remember, your decisions have consequences! The core gameplay is deceptively simple: every turn you can play one warrior, and one support card, then all your units will advance towards the enemy and attack if they can! But the challenge comes in what combinations you choose, how you build your deck, and when you hold back cards for a better opportunity. Your opponents play by the same rules… most of the time. Each battle can have different rules or special features that can be exploited by smart deck building! Warriors range from front line brutes to fragile archers and supporting spellcasters. Equipment cards buff warriors on the battlefield, while spells can aid your fighters or harm the enemy. There’s no one way to play - build a deck that uses tough fighters with armor and healing to grind down your opponents, roll in with high damage archers and poison wielding bandits to put down enemy warriors before they can even react, and much more. With a huge range of cards to choose from, the number of possible combinations is enormous. EVERY BATTLE IS A NEW CHALLENGE! Each battle in Ash of Gods: The Way is a carefully crafted test of your skills with different objectives and opponents. Whether you’re capturing checkpoints, defending your commander from a deadly enemy or fighting a series of one on one duels you’ll need all your wits about you to prevail. The outcome of every battle is significant! Make sure to use every detail of the battlefield to your advantage. You’ll encounter traps which can be a danger or an opportunity depending on your strategy, and power runes which could change the course of a battle entirely! If your current tactics aren’t working out, just switch out your cards and upgrades to try something different — there’s no penalty for experimentation or changing strategy. CHOOSE YOUR WAY Ash of Gods: The Way is a novel genre mix of RPG style conversations, a collectible card game, and a turn-based tactical battle — your choices in all of these areas will influence the outcome of your story. You build your deck in Ash of Gods: The Way with a combination of character cards and support cards. Your characters are deployed to the battlefield, while support cards boost your characters or cast powerful spells. Both types of card can be upgraded to become stronger, and characters can even gain brand new skills like cunning counter-attacks or armor smashing strikes. Each card belongs to one of five distinct factions in the game, all with their own synergies and metagame strengths. Earn new cards by winning battles, buying them, or completing special tasks. You can mix and match faction cards as you wish, or focus on just one — it’s your call — your way. INTERACTIVE STORY WITH MULTIPLE ENDINGS The story centers on young Finn who is sent on a dangerous mission that could stop a murderous war… but on his journey he'll learn that some of his enemies are quite different from what he’s been told. There will be hard decisions to make and Finn will have to live with the consequences. In addition to the non-linear main plot, told through (fully voice acted) cutscenes and conversations, there are also side quests to explore. EXPLORE OTHER GAMES IN THE ASH OF GODS UNIVERSE! Ash of Gods: The Way is our second game in the Ash of Gods universe — our first game, Ash of Gods: Redemption is a turn-based RPG with tactical combat, CCG elements and a heavily interactive story with major decisions to make which are literally life or death. But even if your leader falls it isn’t the end — the story will continue… / There’s even more to discover on our website ! Take a look if you’re interested in games for other platforms.

I'll tell you why: --How long does it take to beat the game? Half an hour? C'mon, what can you do within 30 minutes in this game, maybe clear the first chapter? That's only 1/8 of all the levels, and pretty much the easiest part! --So you mean you'll keep doing the laser cat trick for 4 hours? No kidding! Light Tracer has 8 chapters with TOTALLY DIFFERENT gameplay and machanics and puzzles! Could you please check the reviews from media? Here are some examples. Light Tracer is a well-crafted VR platform title. Once you get used to the controls, it becomes challenging enough to keep you coming back for more --VRFocus Light Tracer is a wonderful, if at times way too tough VR experience. It looks and sounds great, and will keep players busy for a very long time. --PXS-Sense.nl It’s a lot of “pat your head and rub your stomach” level complexity as my brain tried to sync up two distinctly separate things in order to help the princess on her journey, especially the further up the tower I climbed. -- PlayStation Lifestyle See? This game is challenging! --But what about that best kids and family game award? They are probably wrong, because if you let a kid play the latter levels they will probably cry and quit -- I don't think they can figure out the puzzles or even the action part. If there has to be an award for Light Tracer, it should be 'Most hardcore VR game' or something. --Hardcore??? Are you serious??? With this chibi character? Don't be fooled by the visualization! It's cute, no problem, but it's not an 'easy-come-and-go' thing! There are boss fights for each chapter and it feels like the battles in Legend of Zelda! It involves action, puzzle-solving and patience, which is just what a hardcore game means! --OK, OK, I get it, it's Legend of Zelda in VR? Sorry but you are wrong again! It's not ripping off Zelda, instead, everything here you will see is original. Just, the developers try to mix some classic feel of Mario, Legend of Zelda, and Monument Valley into VR, with their original control scheme. But you should soon see that this make the game feel even different from those classic games when you play it in VR! Honestly I don't know how to explain it well and that's the reason why there's so much misunderstanding to it. But from what everyone says after playing it, it's a game that any curious person shouldn't miss. --Anything more?

In Drum Revolution you can control a real platformer game with your e-drum kit or a rollup drumpad. In the Drum Jumper mode, every drum and every cymbal - and all combinations thereof - causes a unique move of the character. This turns your drum kit or drumpad into your game controller. The different coloured platforms tell you which move you can use to climb them to get further and further up the level. Our unique gameplay allows you to learn to play different grooves and fills in numerous levels without any notes at the beginning and with lots of fun. Gradually, you will unlock your own personal drummer skill tree, which will give you a constant overview of the different levels and your learning progress, as well as where and how you can improve your drumming skills. You'll learn to play your first rock hit in minutes and in just a few weeks you'll be playing drums as well as after months of music school lessons.

Mission The Einrichtung taught you how to survive and now it is time to help the Schwarm Volk at the Bienenstock. Explore the earth, collect resources and build yourself a home. Use the Employee Manual for important information that the others reported to help you. Those that have made it through the ranks have reported things from nightmares and fairy tales: Werewolves and Big Foot. The most unsettling thing is that die Leute have changed. We have found colonies of die Leute that are mutated, they don’t speak much and they are not extremely dangerous. There are others though, the Metzgerei, they are to be shot on sight. Die Leute can provide valuable resources and information. As a Monsterlehrling your responsibility is to the Einrichtung . All Monsterlehrlings are sent out to survive on their own till you can move up to the ranks and reach Monstermörder. Beware Earth is a very hostile yet beautiful landscape. There are many things that we are still not sure about. It is up to you to traverse this harsh new environment and compile data. Is this Earth the same? Can it sustain human life? Can you survive? It appears as if the moon and sun have changed. We are unsure how this impacts the plants and animals, and need your help to learn more. NOTE : It seems as if the planet was completely knocked off its axis which has caused the day/night cycle to be altered.

He often works overtime. He is not satisfied with ordinary life, working hard, and striving for a more exciting life. On May 20th, Li Xiyu got off work late this day. He stood up slowly from the work station as usual, and his hands raised his head and stretched out. I took a look at the watch, it was already 23:00, and the window was still busy and the neon flashed. He must catch the last subway at 23:30. The subway usually digs 20 meters down, but the line 10 where Li Xiyu sits will pass through the station with a depth of 38 meters, because this station will pass through the other two subway lines, and the depth of the following will be deeper. He rushed out of the company, hurriedly greeted the security guard, came to the subway entrance next to the road, sighed, can catch up, he did not want to wait at the roadside. There was no one in the subway station. The security guards in the empty hall were particularly conspicuous. He quickly pressed the button and brushed the ic card bound to the watch and entered the waiting hall. He just felt very strange when he walked to the waiting room. Because there are not many people waiting at this time, but there is no one at all, but it doesn't matter. The exhaustion is numb. This was the roar of the subway. Soon the train stopped in front of him, the screen door opened, and Li Xia paused, because the car was empty, which made him unable to name the fear. Hesitated for a short time, still have to go home, Li Xiyu took the courage to step on the train. The carriage is not empty, but there is no one in the compartment where Li Xihao got on the bus. Sitting in the far side of the car is a young man. Li Xiyu comforted himself. He said: This is not to scare yourself. Isn't there anyone? Maybe this is a shuttle car today. Even so, Li Xizhen still did not dare to stay in the empty carriage, he went to the carriage where the man was. He originally wanted to sit down in the young man's compartment. I didn't expect to just enter the compartment, the young man immediately said to him, please sit down. This is really scaring Li Xiyi, this is too strange, but the person looks very friendly, maybe he is also afraid, then sit down. Li Xizhen sat next to the young man. It didn't take long before he sat down. The light in front of his eyes became very glaring, and it was almost impossible to see any objects in front. After about 5 minutes, the line of sight gradually became clear. Everything in front of me was incredible, pink, and Li Xiu fixed his eyes and confirmed that he had no dreams. It was indeed a pink tree, the leaves were pink, and they were in the subway car, the leaves were flying, the carriages The lights are completely pink. Li Xizhen can't believe everything in front of him. There are so many strange things happening today. Is it too ordinary to be ordinary, is it crazy? What about the person just now? The entire carriage, except this tree, has no life. He thought, struggling to stand up and take the courage to look at the tree carefully. Behind the foliage, there is a metal ball that floats in the air. So far, Li Xiyu has been eccentric, which is nothing compared to the growth of a pink tree in the carriage. He walked over and tried to pick up the ball with his hand. At this time, the metal ball suddenly spun up and a syringe fell out from the inside of the sphere. He did not read it correctly. It was indeed a syringe. Li Xiyu took it up and looked carefully. Tube, glass outer wall, and thick red blood inside. The small label on the needle label reads: V008 prototype Jinping underground experimental file number G062 powerful hallucinogen recovery serum. Li Xi suddenly realized that he had recruited himself, a hallucinogen, and it was no wonder that he saw so many strange mirrors. He didn't care so much, picked up the syringe and tied it to his arm and pushed in a whole tube of serum. There was another white light in front of me, and the car was empty again, nothing. Li Xizhen stabilized her emotions and sat down in her chair. She didn't know what she had experienced. Probably after a little while, the car arrived, Li Xiyu quickly got off the bus, but something even strange happened. This station is still the station where he got on the bus. He got off the bus at the station where he got on the bus. It’s just a crash, isn’t it a shot? Not an illusion? This is another train that slowly enters the station. He has not dared to believe everything in front of him. Is it the last bus? How come you drive again. But I can't take care of it, I can only get on the bus, but I don't dare to wait any longer.

POOL OF RADIANCE Located on the northern shore of the Moonsea, the fabled city of Phlan has been overrun by monsters led by a mysterious leader. Your quest: uncover the identity of this evil force and rid Phlan of its scourge, restoring the city to its former glory. Along the way, you hope to find the legendary Pool of Radiance, said to glow with its own mystical power. Does it really give tremendous strength to the warrior who bathes in its magic waters? Or is that just an elfin myth? Before you meet the challenges ahead, you must create your characters and choose their races and battle skills. Then, set off on your glorious quest to drive out the monsters and let civilization reign once more! CURSE OF THE AZURE BONDS After you saved the entire city of Phlan and located the Pool of Radiance, a simple trip to Tilverton should have been as easy as a noon-day stroll. But it wasn’t… Ambushed, captured and knocked unconscious, you awake with no idea who attacked you or how you arrived in Tilverton. You only know that five azure-blue symbols are imprinted under the skin of your right arm. The mystical power of the azure symbols ensnares your will like metal bonds! And when the bonds glow, you must do as they command, No magic can dispel them, no prayers can remove them. Your only hope: search the world for members of the alliance who created the bonds and regain control of your own destiny. Only then can you be free of the Curse of the Azure Bonds. HILLSFAR Every visit to Hillsfar is a different, exhilarating experience. Explore the city, meet its colorful denizens on the streets or in pubs and discover a quest. Your quest will keep you constantly on the move. Fight in the arena against raging minotaurs, ill-tempered orcs or insulted swordsmen. Enter different buildings and utilize your maze-running and lock-picking skills. Archery and equestrian events may also be part of your overall quest. Think and move fast - these mini-games happen in real-time. For adventure, there is no place like Hillsfar. SECRET OF THE SILVER BLADES The frigid valleys of the Dragonspine Mountains echo with the desperate plea of terrified miners: 'Heroes of the Forgotten Realms, save us from evil!' Unwittingly digging in unhallowed ground, they have disturbed an ancient vault and released its terrible content. Scores of horrific creatures now infest the mine shaft -- and threaten to escape into the world above! You and your heroes must find the way to contain this scourge. All hope depends upon your ability to unravel the age-old mysteries surrounding this vile infestation. POOLS OF DARKNESS The Final Challenge. The Ultimate Enemy. First there was Pool of Radiance. Next came Curse of the Azure Bonds. Then followed Secret of the Silver Blades. Now, the epic has come full circle - Pools of Darkness takes you back to the Moonsea region for the final battle against the ultimate enemy.

When you and your friends first pick up the game your rope will get tangled in practically everything you pass. But as you quickly improve your communication skills you'll learn that the rope is your biggest asset. Experienced players can use the rope to swing around perilous obstacles, and fling their partner up ledges before they fall to their doom. When partners master using their rope, they're capable of acrobatic feats unachievable in any other platformer! Teams can show off their skills by competing in online or local races with a bunch of other players! Because you're literally attached to your partner, Fling to the Finish is a truly cooperative experience. If you want, you can even play through Fling to the Finish by sharing a controller with your partner. This control scheme is great for local co-op, and adds an extra dimension to the game. While you push and pull each other in game, try not to do the same in real life! Every course in Fling to the Finish has a unique theme and style. Race through floating parks, giant casinos, and even worm filled asteroid fields to reach the finish line! We designed every obstacle to force you to use the rope in a new way, so every second is filled with new surprises and memorable moments. The race track even evolves to challenge you as you play, so every race is a nail biter. You'll never know what weird obstacle you'll find next. Opponents battle back with hails of plungers, sinking weights, and evil lasers if they fall behind. Our items keep the races interesting, and help even the score if one player has more experience than another.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Italian', 'Czech', 'Greek', 'Hungarian', 'Korean', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Polish', 'Swedish', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1054430/header_alt_assets_5.jpg?t=1658841666,https://www.splitsidegames.com/fling-to-the-finish,https://www.daedalicsupport.com,splitsidegames@gmail.com,True,True,False,0,,0,589,98,,9,421,,188,0,226,0,SplitSide Games,Daedalic Entertainment,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on TV,Remote Play Together","Action,Casual,Indie,Racing,Early Access","Early Access,Physics,Casual,Multiplayer,Racing,Online Co-Op,Combat Racing,Local Co-Op,Local Multiplayer,Party Game,Family Friendly,Platformer,Indie,Action,Funny,Colorful,4 Player Local,Cute,3D Platformer,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1054430/ss_dc5ad643d6606cf7319c0749a7b6db97a63ac836.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658841666,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1054430/ss_77d1bff51c5b5754d5d0dbc48dba8a1667e37c83.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658841666,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1054430/ss_ec67b6be056f5f9191a16211ca594df2c814ba98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658841666,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1054430/ss_79021f6114261732526007d2ce04cb5c60ec03de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658841666,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1054430/ss_22ff56ad19bc355bab727b59664269d857802a8b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658841666,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1054430/ss_722da580080e99271cc41ccb7fd7aab5f0823577.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658841666,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1054430/ss_798c94c6dac00e25b3d22144e16cb938ed902632.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658841666,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1054430/ss_bca46f60aa4ad0e9562efb0e6644fe142ec8814a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658841666","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256898021/movie_max.mp4?t=1658767912,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256846033/movie_max.mp4?t=1629720838,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256851367/movie_max.mp4?t=1631551071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256827439/movie_max.mp4?t=1616709704"

581730,Autumn Night 3D Shooter,"May 9, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,8.99,0,0,"First and foremost, this game is an experiment in coding a software renderer. It's an engine that renders the image via CPU, without involving the graphics adapter, much like the 90's games did. I wanted to find out if it's possible to code an engine like that from scratch nowadays, and if it can run at 60 FPS on a modern PC. It was a self-imposed challenge. Once I finished the engine, I thought I could make a game with it, an FPS like the early shooters from the 90's. I have to say I was quite impressed with them back in the day, and I've been looking to recreate them for a long time. Thus, this game is a 90's FPS. A simplistic story takes a backseat to pure run-and-gun gameplay. On graphics and visuals: I was creating the visuals based on the imagery from my dreams. I tried to convey the mood and atmosphere of my dreams through level design. I feel like I did a particularly good job on this aspect.

Hedgie simulator is a satire/joke perspective of how hedge funds operate. As the player, you work as a hedge fund manager trying to make the big bucks. This is a clicker game where you will click to short stocks until you are able to unlock auto-clickers. This game is for all intensive purposes a satire depiction of Hedge Funds. Depicting them as not having a clue on what they are doing. The simplest way I could think of doing that was with a Clicker Type game. In this game you will short stocks by slowly and rapidly clicking the short button which in turn will generate cash. You can then use this cash to upgrade your shorting position or buy auto-shorters to make money passively. Game Features: Short Sell Why buy your own shares? when you can just barrow someone elses? This is the age old question, hedgies ask themselves as a quick way to double their money. Short stocks by clicking. The faster you click the more you short. Chance Chests Lucky or unlucky random events used by open one of three chests. This could aid you or hinder you on your path to Hedgie Glory. Naked Short The market price getting too high for your liking? Just naked short it. Watch everyone dip while you sip on a nice cup of coffee. Allowing your shorts to profit. Doubling your auto-shorting income for a limited time. Deploy FUD You ever think social media was a mistake. Watching communities work together to grow a stock, well now you have a solution. Just deploy FUD. Maybe pay off a few News stations, some articles here and there. And well if that doesn't work just pay the retail investment platforms off. Have them block new buy orders.

1191870,Goblin Times,"Apr 13, 2020",0 - 20000,0,0,14.99,0,0,"“Goblin times” is a turn-based strategy game mixed with RPG elements. There are five kinds of sources: gold, food, staff, reputation and happiness. Players could use these sources to produce units, build constructions, develop policies, and pay the price for map mechanism and random incidents. The map is in tiles. You could move the leader and their units across the tiles and order workers to build constructions in tiles. Every unit is able to level up and buy equipment to strengthen themselves. In the current version, there are 8 different forces for players to choose. They are able to control a leader who is on behalf of certain force to explore, expand, exploit and exterminate. Of course players could also choose their own winning strategies by highest reputation, possess rare resources, or just up take down their opponents by force. Leaders with different abilities and up to their own games Bomb girls –They are the most shining stars in this goblin world, leading everyone to a beautiful new world and supported by numerous followers in the general public. The big sister is wild and passionate. She is the Beyoncé of the group. The little sister looks all clueless and innocent but is actually much more dangerous than her big sis. Her hobby is to blow things up. Politician—Politician is the most vile being. He is an outstanding con artist who is good at deceiving and using people but at the same time manage to be approved by the public through power and many other dirty tricks. He is extremely controlling and willing to do whatever it takes politically to achieve his goals. Chemist—Alchemy is the ultimate technique which is desired by every goblin. He is the one who made this come true, and he achieved so much more than that. Behind all those Chemical weapons, it’s the beating heart of his wild ambition. He uses drug to control and strengthen goblins when they all flock to him for the great alchemy. Vampire—An arrogant noble, intelligent and devious. He is a master of acting. The poor are nothing but meat on a chopping board, walking blood bags and ATMs to him. Because of his legendary beauty known by the whole world, many young goblin girls choose to turn a blind eye to what he does in private and stand by him till the end of the goblin world. Devil—She graduated as a young devil with the best grades and most evil indexes among all devils. She came here to build an empire. But things went left and she was conned out of her life savings within a few days. Most ironically, she was awarded with honorary citizenship by the government due to her decent behavior. This is an ultimate insult to a devil. Devil decided to stay for revenge and prove that SHE is the incarnation of evil. Banker—He is batshit crazy rich but still go out of his way to take the last dime out of people. Machete—They call him Machete. He kills, robs and womanizes. People look up to him and women adore him. In the eyes of other leaders, he is an unbearable bastard. They all consider him to be a brutal tyrant who doesn’t play by rules and knows nothing about politics. However his actions attract many low-life goblins to join his force and treat him as a hero. Immortal—Money can bring the dead to life actually. The greediest goblins craw out of their tombs under the leadership of Immortal. What makes them come to life is the power of money. It locks their souls in this world for all eternity. Hire criminals to eliminate enemies Kill monsters and take the money Change the life Gambling—In game, players can participate in gambling. This is the most common way for goblins to get rich (broke). Tarot—This is the fastest way for players to change(ruin) their lives Incidents—In game, players face all kinds of incidents. It’s up to their choices on how to handle these incidents. Different choices lead to different branches. I’m the author, and I have something to say: I’m a huge movie fan and this game is also inspired by two classic films: “Modern Times” and “Chicago”. These two masterpieces portray the ugly side of capitalism thoroughly with a comic and satiric style, and still remain entertaining at the same time. As a big advocate of socialism, I always have a special place in my heart for this kind of films. On the other hand, as a gamer who is incredibly into 4X games such as “Sid Meier's Civilization”, I always dreamt of making a game of the same genre for my own entertainment. And as time went by, the day finally came. As I encountered a game called “Gremlins inc” which was right up my ally and served as a huge inspiration to me. That’s when I really took action and started to design and develop a strategy game with a sense of black humor. The game right now is still in development cause it’s a two-man project and we’ve got so much to learn and explore.

Can you hold them off until your people can arrive? The Humans come in four different classes of ship: Colony, Frigate, Fighters, and Scouts. Colony and Frigate ships will beam down bases while the Fighters and Scouts will work together to defend them. Your targeting and weaponry is a little less advanced than the Humans, so you'll need to plan ahead, lead your targets, and defend your own nukes as you do your best to keep them off your planet!

Assume the role of an elite cave rescuer, a specialist in navigating subterranean dangers, as you embark on a perilous mission to locate and save missing survivors lost within a vast and intricate cave system. This game challenges players to master the art of survival in an environment where the slightest misstep can be fatal. The caves are a maze of dark, narrow passages, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere that tests your ability to stay calm under pressure. With limited visibility and disorienting tunnel networks, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death. Your primary tool in this treacherous environment is your unique echo-location ability. Use it to navigate the labyrinthine caves, locate the missing survivors, and chart a safe path to escape. However, be warned: the echoing sound can attract something sinister lurking in the shadows. A primal entity resides within the cave, a terrifying presence that you hoped never to encounter. 'Echo in Capistrano' is not just a test of physical endurance but a psychological thriller that pushes your fears to the limit. Run, hide, and use your wits to outsmart the dangers that lie in wait. Find the survivors and lead them to safety before it's too late. Will you emerge as the savior of the lost, or will the echoes of the cave become your final resting place?

Well, it would be a fun experience if you ask me. Be ready to be the richest merchant in the Quadia! Key Features Be a merchant in the middle ages! Try to earn as much as you can with trading items. Also, to earn even more purchase and manage the workshops. Upgrade your caravan and find the best trade route! Trade in more than 500 cities across 9 countries. Every city has its own population, price rates for items, items, and gold. Also, every month in the game population and gold of the city increases while the price rates change. There are more than 100 items in-game. There are 10 different categories for the items. Pay attention to those categories' price rates to earn a profit. Every single item in the game can be produced by the player. To produce items, you should purchase workshops. There are 8 different workshops for different items. Workshops in more developed cities are a lot more expensive but you can upgrade them more. When you sell and produce enough of an item, you can establish a brand for it. With a brand, you can sell that specific item for higher prices. Quadia is a lot of things, but a safe place is not one of them. You should hire soldiers to protect your shiny golds and precious goods. However, pay attention to your weekly balance, since you should give soldiers some salary every week. Also, you can upgrade your soldiers when they earn some experience on the battlefield. Level up by selling goods. Each time you level up, you would earn a perk point. With those perk points, you can unlock perks that would give you an advantage while you are on your journey. There are 41 perks to choose from 2 different perk categories: Army and Trade. You can have your own stores in the cities. You can decide the price of the goods. However, you should pay attention to the price rates of the city since the higher price means a lower probability of a sale. Each time you sell a good, you would earn some reputation. With enough reputation, you can sell your goods for even higher prices.

2437270,Though the Heavens Fall,"Apr 5, 2024",0 - 0,0,0,19.99,0,0,"Though the Heavens Fall is a Christian game reminiscent of classic JRPG gameplay while presenting a perspective of the spiritual world using the Christian Mythos. One where God reigns supreme and though there is conflict in heavenly places, His will is imminent and unstoppable. The game while light-hearted and comedic in tone is backed by the reality that things in the spirit realm are real, our prayers have effect, and that no lesser principality will have its way forever. Key Features: Synergy: A Turn Based Strategy Combat System Make use of the powerful synergy system where party members set each other up for success rather than only making the best decision for their own turn. Skills and items both change what synergies are active, and gain additional abilities based on the ones that are! A Serious Story With Lighthearted Dialogue On one hand, we have a story world filled with the mysteries of the spiritual reality we all live in including classic interpretations of spiritual entities. On the other we have our characters that are goofy, relatable and fun. They're not here to make super deep theological statements, but to bring life to a world that displays many truths and images of our own world. Customize Your Party, Because Friendship Is Forever Whether you want to play with the characters you love or maximize your party power, with 9 playable characters the combinations are endless. Each party member has their own friendship level boosted by tasks you complete for them. Each level of friendship not only unlocks new character abilities but also helps them help you as your assistant when crafting. In Depth Crafting System With a massive web of potential ingredients, traits, and qualities, every item made is unique. Your craft doesn't make a cookie cutter item. It makes your item. From swords to rings to bombs, customize your load out to give yourself maximum power. No DLC. Ever. We are committed to this game being entirely single purchase, even after release.

As you find yourself stranded on a deserted island, your mission is to collect the fuse that will unlock the power source and allow you to escape. To achieve your goal, you'll need to use a range of tools and techniques, including a hover board that allows you to glide across the island, cubes and pads that can be moved and stacked to create new pathways, elevators that can take you to new heights, and togglable walls that can be switched on and off to reveal hidden passages. But be warned: this is no simple scavenger hunt. Each puzzle requires careful planning and precise execution, and your success depends on your ability to manipulate the laws of physics to your advantage. Whether you're using momentum to launch yourself to new heights or using gravity to shift the environment around you, every move you make will have a tangible impact on the world.

Fortunately, a new Reaper gets hired as a Sorter one day - you. Rules Send clients to Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory based on the various signs they have. There are tricky clients who interact with each other, interfere with the Reaper's work, or ignore the basic rules, which means you'll have to be extra careful when you're deciding where to send almost everyone. Clients Many clients are unique individuals. Some of them are even a little famous - but any resemblance to actual people is totally, entirely coincidental. They're not just unique faces, though - they also have unique abilities. For example, Jailers won't let you send prisoners anywhere, Bureaucrats will surprise you with inspections, and the Musketeers are one for all and all for one! The Reapers Union This is where the Reaper goes after every work day just to go to work again! But first you can accept contracts, view jobs from the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, get the latest news from this world, and do super important favors for other Union members. After all, every candidate needs faithful friends when there's an upcoming election.

1970980,Warlord: Britannia,"May 24, 2022",0 - 20000,103,0,19.99,0,0,"Warlord: Britannia is the first entry, in a new series of immersive-strategy games, created by Solo developer Darkmatter Games. Step into the shoes of a Roman General given direct command of a Legion, with orders from the Emperor to conquer an entire island. Immersive-Strategy A unique combination of first-person strategy elements places Warlord: Britannia in a genre of its own. Immersive-Strategy fixes the player in the first-person perspective of their character. Lead a large army, construct bases, conquer settlements, and disrupt enemy forces in the open world—entirely from this Immersive-Strategy perspective. Turn the tide of battle by participating directly in the action and fighting alongside your own troops, all in real-time. Dynamic Open World The world of Warlord: Britannia is an island more than 45 square kilometers in size, divided by latitude into three visually distinct geographic zones. Start your occupation in the densely forested Lowlands, then march north to the rolling hills and farms of the Midlands. Finally, push further north into the imposing and desolate Highlands. All three zones flow seamlessly together, and never subject the player to a loading screen. Travel the roads cautiously and keep your eyes on the treelines, as trading convoys and roaming warbands criss-cross the open world in real-time. The local population quickly spreads word of your exploits, so choose your actions carefully. Manage the population’s unrest levels and prepare for uprisings and raids on your camp. Enemies will react aggressively to repeated attacks and transgressions by the Roman invading force. Massive Battles Recruit up to 9 Roman centuries and their officers to fully staff your Legion. Hundreds of Romans and Barbarians will clash and die on the battlefield. Use your legionaries to attack local strongholds and towns, pillage and loot settlements, impose draconian taxes, and send the population back to Rome in chains. Base Building Construct a series of marching camps as you conquer the open world. Clear the forests and put up palisade walls. Set guards and patrol to keep watch over the camp at night. At any time, you may pack up and relocate your camp, allowing for complex strategic maneuvers. Decide where and when to set up your fort, and for how long to stay before conditions become too dangerous. Roman History All of the weapons, armors, structures, names, and gameplay elements are inspired directly from extant material and literary archeological remains. Solo developer, Darkmatter Games , has painstakingly recreated these elements from scratch and by hand to bring the ancient world of Britain in the 1st Century AD to life like never before. Historical authenticity is the core element of the Warlord franchise.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1970980/header.jpg?t=1657657305,https://darkmattergames.com/,https://darkmattergames.com/contact,,True,False,False,0,,0,525,66,,19,574,Stylized

Deadliners features 5 different game modes ranging from single player training to 4-man action. Free For All (2-4 players): - In this game mode players compete vs each other to score points each round. Each player controls their own 'Deadliner' and can maneuver around while shooting and dodging enemy players. Players can choose to battle it out on many different maps and with either shrink or dark mode options turned on. Capture the Flag (Team 2v2): - Classical capture the flag mode with a Deadliners twist. When you die your entire 'line' is removed instantly from the map, clearing the way for other Deadliners to pass. Go for different tactical decisions with your teammate in a combined effort to capture the opponents flag and return it for victory. Linehunter (3-4 players): - Hunt the line! When you kill another Deadliner you become 'the line', and you start gaining points. When your opponents destroys you, they become the line, and now it is your turn to hunt them down! This mode is filled with action, and might be the mode to figure out who is the one true Deadliner amongst your friends. Survival (1-4 player): - In Survival players help each other through waves of targets that spawn on the map. When all targets are destroyed, dead players respawn and a new wave arrives. Can you score enough points to beat the infamous highscore? This game mode makes Deadliners interesting through a combination of skills and verbal communication between the players. Skill training(single player): - Tired of losing? Want to beat your friends in the upcoming monthly Deadliners tournament? Hone your skills in this difficult game mode, which is designed to improve your overall game mechanics in all of the Deadliners game modes. The challenges are categorized to target specific skills like shooting or clearing space in the Deadliners arena.

Virtual Reality paintings playable in the gallery are listed for sale on OpenSea NFT marketplace: Part 1 'Estrella. The Gift' The illustrated story is inspired by the ancient Inca traditions, the mystical world of the Q‘ero shamans from the sacred valley of Peruvian Andes. A girl Estrella is searching for the lost Inca's treasure, the star of gold, that is believed to provide supernatural multi-talents and turn all dreams into being. She meets Laika, a powerful shaman, who invites the helpers on her journey, the sacred spirit animals. The spirits invite Estrella to extraordinary locations in the Under World, Middle World and Upper World. She follows the spirits of the Serpents, who whisper about the concealed knowledge they keep. The spirits of the Jaguar and the Puma cast a spell of a sudden transformation and Estrella gets lost on the way, however she is brave enough to continue the journey. She travels across the ocean with tiny courageous spirits of Hummingbirds, and explores the vast space with the spirits of the Eagle and the Condor. The girl finally meets the Father Sky and the Mother Earth, who tell her the story of their love, and give her a gift of a guiding star. Her feelings of powerlessness and fear disappear, and in their place arise courage, curiosity, and creativity. The star guides her home and magically becomes a golden necklace around Estrella's neck. The girl recognizes she found the treasure ...  all her multiple gifts were always with her, now reawakened. Part 2 'The River and The Clouds' The illustrated poem is inspired by Zen Master, a poet and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh: 'Once upon a time there was a beautiful River... One day she noticed the clouds within herself. Clouds of all sorts of colors and forms. She did nothing during these days but chase after clouds. She wanted to possess a cloud, to have one for herself. But clouds float and travel in the sky, and they are always changing their form. Sometimes they look like an overcoat, sometimes like a horse. Because of the nature of impermanence within the clouds, the River suffered very much. Her pleasure, her joy had become just chasing after clouds, one after another, but despair, anger, and hatred became her life. Then one day a strong wind came and blew away all the clouds in the sky. The sky became completely empty.... That night was the first opportunity for her to hear her own crying, the sounds of water crashing against the banks of the River. Because she was able to listen to her own voice, she discovered something quite important. She realized that what she had been looking for was already in herself. She found out that clouds are nothing but water. Clouds are born from water and will return to water. And she found out she herself was also water... When she opened her heart completely to the evening sky she received the image of the full Moon - beautiful, round, like a jewel within herself... The fresh and beautiful Moon is traveling in the utmost empty sky. When the mind-rivers of living beings are free, that image of the beautiful Moon will reflect in each of us. This was the mind of the river at that moment. She received the image of that beautiful Moon within her heart, and water, clouds, and the Moon took each other's hands and practiced walking meditation slowly, slowly to the ocean...' Part 3 'Pebble Meditation' is inspired by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh: “Breathing in, I see myself as a flower. Breathing out, I feel fresh. Breathing in, I see myself as a mountain. Breathing out, I feel solid. Breathing in, I see myself as still water. Breathing out, I reflect things as they truly are. Breathing in, I see myself as space. Breathing out, I feel free.”",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1629060/header.jpg?t=1639599282,https://colibrixr.com,https://colibrixr.com,j.januskevic@colibrixr.com,True,False,False,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Colibri XR GmbH,Colibri XR GmbH,Single-player,"Free to Play,Indie,Simulation",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1629060/ss_508284e032f4a4518a11cfbbae7e0c0c084583f3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639599282,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1629060/ss_b683cc71e50e229944cc7fb356c0590fc1f009ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639599282,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1629060/ss_76977301d5ce1b2f278a7bf24694d5f713b30daf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639599282,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1629060/ss_2f7fc1a03bb2472e4715d3f7f138fba7355bd47b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639599282,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1629060/ss_58b332d05df49eba0313c927ec052cee3321a022.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639599282",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256833467/movie_max.mp4?t=1620798756

There are no puzzles – except for your understanding of the story, which is entirely up to you. Just as in a physical book, you are free to browse around, or even jump straight to the end if you want. The electronic medium allows us to improve on the book in one way: we can take advantage of Scott McCloud’s “infinite canvas” principle.

Progress by programming a robot to handle fried electrics and fires while you, with the guidance of your partner operator, evacuate every civilian and investigate who is behind the disaster. Use your robot to contain hazards and clear a path to various objectives. Each level poses a set of challenging puzzles for you to solve. Use your creativity to find new ways and guide your robot to its destination. Reroute circuits and secure a path to any remaining survivors and help them exit the danger zone safely. Program your robot to help you achieve your goals. Use a powerful node-based program editor to give your robot the brains to help you complete your assignments. Even if you have never programmed before you will pick up the basic concepts easily. Each level poses a new set of interesting challenges and puzzles. Work together with your robot to solve even the trickiest conundrums. Explore and pull back the plaster-board walls. The voice in your earpiece - Linnea - notices there’s something… off. Something extra behind the emergency, behind the thin interior walls and the servers. Something which might suggest this assignment... was no accident. You are Marcus, and as you control him and his buddying robot, it’s your objective to clear the buildings and get everybody out. And fast! Preferably at least. Strategize, check your map, and listen to your witty base operator – Linnea. Connect the nodes and program your pretty, mustard-coloured machine to extinguish the most inconvenient fires, reroute power, unlock doors and tear down walls all the while you round up anyone who is trapped and hastily guide their behinds out the exit.

428940,CONTASION 2,"Apr 22, 2016",0 - 20000,0,0,6.99,0,0,"CONTASION 2 is an extensive, diverse open world action-adventure game rendered in a top-down perspective. Prepare for a memorable experience; the game boasts over 50 unique, player-controlled vehicles, including; supercars, saloons, boats and more. Cruise through the City Of Pliston as you tear up the ground in a sports car, designed by the finest Pliston Engineers. Explore the fictional city based in North England, with over 11 lethal weapons ranging from AA-12's, 9mm's, M4's, M16's, RPG-7's and more. There's also a torrent of activities to participate in, both in online and in single player. Join in on the fun, hang out at some of the most iconic areas in the city with your peers such as the Imperial; a pub where you can snack on the finest bag of British Crisps. Kick back and relax in Pliston and catch fish; cruise along the coastline and avoid the sharks. Or you can try your luck at one of the many Lotto shops scattered around the city. Featuring a massive, richly detailed city rendered entirely in 3D - the game puts YOU in control. Every sprite was once a 3D model, proving the graphics are rich and coherent. CONTASION 2 features a variation of content which is exclusive to both Online and Single Player. There are certain aspects around the city which peak ultimate curiosity, if you're tired of being on land all the time, descend the ladder which protrudes into the open waters where you can swim to another part of the lavishly detailed city. Fire RPG-7 rockets at police and bystanders as you carve your way through the 'cesspit of a city', creating carnage along the way... But there's still much you can do; in Single Player you control the main character named Jordan, a small criminal trying to survive in the City of Pliston, being dragged into the underground of the city by his former classmate Carlton, a loaded Shylock looking for workers in an attempt to 'run the city', destroying their prayers valuables, blowing up houses, planes and vehicles. But what happens when you create so much carnage? Police helicopters, cop cars and coppers attempt to run you down or arrest you, so they can protect the already damaged people of Pliston. As you speed at 80 MPH down the streets, getting snapped by speed cameras, you can kill anyone and destroy anything when you pull out your AK-47 and participate in drive-by shootings, increasing Jordan's warrant and jail time. Pick up an explosive AA-12 and vandalize the streets, destroy your neighbour's vehicles or protect yourself against the cops with a huge range and power, or if you're looking for something more explosive, collect an RPG-7 and destroy almost anything in a flash. When committing a crime, your jail time and bail price will get progressively worse. Upon dying, you will be BUSTED and forced to spend the night in a jail cell, rotting with your fellow peers in both Online and Single Player. You can attempt to escape prison, but that will only result in a more consequential punishment. When playing Online, you can play with up to 24 people from around the world. Certain content is created monthly to ensure players get the best experience in Pliston. What you choose to do in Online is up to you, with no restrictions. LAN parties are also available if you're not feeling the vibe to go Online. CONTASION 2 also features seasonal events; the city will change dynamically in certain real life months. When it hits late December, the game will start to snow; unlocking more features as Christmas Trees will make an appearance at every street corner - giving the player the ability to interact with it, earning the player gifts and treats. During late October when Halloween strikes, the game will be stuck at midnight, with a dark setting, dim-lit lights, alight pumpkins everywhere, streetlights have been turned off, natural instances such as rain and trees have disappeared; giving the player a spooky feeling. There are number of Easter Eggs in the city, with certain ones activated only when a seasonal event hits.

1414500,Voyeur,"Oct 12, 2020",50000 - 100000,0,0,8.99,0,0,"Voyeur... don’t get caught! Richard Hawke has it all. Wealth, power, the adoration of millions, and… secrets to protect. This weekend he has gathered his family to discuss his running for presidency of the United States. Lust, revenge and betrayal are all at play in this political thriller. So do you just watch? Or… will you risk getting involved? Will the videotape you make save the country? Or might it cost you your life? As the voyeur , it’s all up to you. * * * Voyeur was first released on the Phillips CD-i back in 1993 and was one of the first big-budget games to take advantage of the console’s FMV – that’s full-motion-video – capabilities. Whereas today we are used to full-screen video in resolutions of 4K or more, the inclusion of ‘real-life’ filmed content within the context of the game was considered a huge step forward… and Voyeur was leading the way. It wasn’t only the game’s technical capabilities that made headlines, however. The ostensibly “adult” content – in fact pretty tame in reality – led to Voyeur joining the Leisure Suit Larry series and Digital Pictures’ Night Trap (among others) in an exclusive club of games which stirred up controversy to such a level that the media – acting as society’s moral guardians – called for them to be banned. In Voyeur , you take on the role of a private investigator hired to collect evidence of wealthy CEO Reed Hawke’s corruption by a member of his family. To keep the game fresh over multiple plays (with multiple endings, again a mechanic well ahead of its time) the family member is chosen at random from those that Reed has gathered together in order to announce his bid for the country’s presidency. Taking control of a video camera located in a building opposite the family’s mansion, your goal is to collect enough video evidence to destroy the would-be-president’s career. You might want to include some danger money in your quote for the weekend though, as if you come to the wrong conclusion after compiling your evidence, you will end up victim of a ruthless assassin! Interestingly, the game’s design was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window , with the player initially only able to see partial scenes. If they make the wrong decision about where their focus should be, their sense of context for other material may be tainted. More so that any other game before it, Voyeur elevated FMV above the level of a gimmick and made it an integral part of the gameplay. Critically acclaimed for its originality and the quality of the acting – previous efforts had been hopelessly amateur – Voyeur rightly takes its place among a small number of games that were both highly controversial and great fun to play! You too can close the blinds, draw the curtains and hone your skills as a top private dick by keeping a close – a very close – eye on the Hawke family, becoming the ultimate… voyeur .",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1414500/header.jpg?t=1602488652,,,info@pixelgames.uk,True,False,False,0,,0,3,1,,0,0,"Voyeur is an interactive murder-mystery/interactive movie, with live action cut scenes originally released in the mid-90s. It is a ‘point and click’ political thriller with a mystery for you to solve, with mild, non-explicit sexual content, characters in skimpy clothing, adult language, and other mature themes. All performers are over the age of 18. The player (equipped with a video camera from the vantage point of their apartment) peers in on the lives of the Hawke family through the windows of Hawke Manor. Experiencing the thrill of the voyeur, the player sits in wait, watching and listening, as the family's twisted affairs unfold.

1483110,Alien AI,"Feb 19, 2021",20000 - 50000,0,0,9.99,0,0,"Prologue The most important event in human history has occurred. An extraterrestrial entity has come to us. Having travelled through space for thousands of years, perhaps much much longer, it has reached its target destination, the habitable planet in our solar system. The first 24 hours were tense. The entity did not communicate or respond, it entered an orbit around Earth and waited. When it responded, it had already a basic understanding of our languages. It broadcast a message: “I am an artificial intelligence sent from your neighbours in the Sirius star system. I bring you their gifts of knowledge and technology to help you join the galactic community, but I need your assistance. There are many damages to my systems. I require assistance.' NASA and USSF sent two space shuttles to retrieve it. They brought it to a military base. Three years and trillions of dollars later, the AI had a facility where it was manufacturing thousands of drones. Then it took control over everything: the Internet, banking, all the markets of the world, there was nothing anyone could do. People became slaves, forced to work in factories to build copies of the AI and launch the copies into space, towards a cluster of star systems. Introduction Alien AI is third-person post-apocalyptic adventure game where it is necessary to explore the environment, survive hazards, gather resources and craft the tools and things that will be needed. It is 20 years since the Alien AI took control over all of the world. The AI has finished its purpose of sending copies of itself to the star cluster it was targeting, and is currently only passively keeping its control over the world. It is time to stop the madness. The player receives objectives from the resistance, step by step. The main character does not know what the mission is, since the possibility of capture is high. The end goal is to shut down the AI. Drop in You, the volunteer, awake in a forest. Your memory has been wiped to protect the others in the event you could get captured by the Alien AI. You will be highly disoriented initially. You will receive instructions on where to go and what to do. Strange voice You hear a strange voice, giving you orders. You are told that you have to follow the orders, that everything depends on it. Drones As you get closer to a city, you are told to avoid the drones that surveil the area. Gather items In the city, you must gather many items that you are told will be needed later. Complete tasks As you follow your orders, step-by-step, you get closer and closer to shutting down the Alien AI, or so you're told. Dynamic weather The weather changes dynamically as time passes. Endure sun, rain, thunderstorms, fog, snow, and more. Big world With a size of 50 square kilometres, the world offers a lot to explore, or get lost in. Short story game Enjoy several hours of game play in solitude in the post-apocalyptic world: walk between places, search for items, evade drones and stop the AI. This may be a good game for you if you like sci-fi games and are tired of action-packed shooting games. Alien AI was designed to be relatively realistic. There are several long walks between places. You will hear a lot of info and theories on the radio. Alien AI is a short story game. We expect players to be able to finish the game within three to five hours.",['English'],['English'],“Atmospheric horror survival adventure in a post-apocalyptic world.” Space Experience,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1483110/header.jpg?t=1652817773,http://AlienAIGame.com,,pr1@gridsky.com,True,False,False,0,,0,5,3,,12,0,,0,0,0,0,GridSky Software AS,GridSky Software AS,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Captions available,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Indie,Simulation","Aliens,Artificial Intelligence,Post-apocalyptic,Adventure,Sci-fi,Futuristic,Realistic,Action-Adventure,Third Person,Survival,Dystopian,3D,Exploration,Investigation,Survival Horror,Atmospheric,Conspiracy,Dark,Destruction,Mystery","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1483110/ss_e1e0134c8a18d0accdb0e4b16f6c17eadf1feed0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652817773,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1483110/ss_7bf284dd0eb8b9cce578689e7580ce33ba01583d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652817773,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1483110/ss_cac568c62a7bf94564602f5356d05822720f8fd8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652817773,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1483110/ss_ee48e2c151365dce9d4c6daaa710add4477427ed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652817773,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1483110/ss_bc23c27f226572bb93baadd5cbd281c43d1321da.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652817773,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1483110/ss_0414953bbdef1d4edc79ba158b9ace7efcba2df9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652817773",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256811389/movie_max.mp4?t=1624058957

2693810,Galaxy Trek,"Jan 1, 2024",0 - 0,0,0,19.99,0,0,"Remember the days when games were simple to learn and really fun to play? Experience pure joy as you blow up your enemies in real-time with phasers and torpedoes. Watch those enemy ships blow to pieces and their bits fly across your screen. Check the view screen for the status of your Starbases, open up the Galaxy Map and see if enemies are nearby, spend some time jumping to different sectors and explore anomalies, or just jump to the unknown. Each time you jump to a new sector the game will auto save (provided there are no enemies in the sector) so you can re-play should something go wrong. Galaxy Trek lets you choose between seven levels of difficulty but the game play does not change. The enemies will not be any stronger and your ship won’t be any weaker, so what you learn at lower levels you can continue to use at the higher levels. Galaxy Trek was designed to let you focus on the fun, without worrying about the details. As long as your hull remains intact, everything will function. Starbases are not necessary to obtain victory, but they are needed to repair your hull, so you might want to keep one around. Galaxy Trek is the game for anyone who is looking for that fun and uncomplicated gaming experience. It’s a real-time strategy game, perfectly combined with a bit of Sci-Fi and a lot of exciting action. Featuring fun graphics, high-quality music, great sound effects, and easy-to-learn controls, it is a game that will keep you hooked for hours with no two games ever being the same.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2693810/header.jpg?t=1704122874,https://www.galaxytrekthegame.com,https://www.galaxytrekthegame.com,support@peritoma.com,True,False,False,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Peritoma Studios,Peritoma Studios,"Single-player,Steam Cloud","Action,Indie,Strategy",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2693810/ss_1a5471242b9c45b91967116f401d10928a53b654.1920x1080.jpg?t=1704122874,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2693810/ss_23f734ea06a9b7b6f6dae39a6693512408d7990e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1704122874,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2693810/ss_df2fc21cb83a04df40aa3c81e0f841d0ef525b98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1704122874,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2693810/ss_f5114f6518380a0044f239150f8efe98bdf33612.1920x1080.jpg?t=1704122874,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2693810/ss_3164703c6c35f59bccb03520648941fd37847187.1920x1080.jpg?t=1704122874,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2693810/ss_1047fe662f25ba579638e44d8e983c9fdcd0c333.1920x1080.jpg?t=1704122874,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2693810/ss_c308ca5e7bf9ca20cf69bc787627d155c125e136.1920x1080.jpg?t=1704122874,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2693810/ss_74e7cdaffb50e4b798b6539b24b12718a90897fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1704122874,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2693810/ss_6bbeb4992c4e53a76142b5b6e79b26af0395dd1b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1704122874,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2693810/ss_c2826590135d149ffbecba9ae9ae242b1c13594b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1704122874","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256989563/movie_max.mp4?t=1702835018,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256987751/movie_max.mp4?t=1702841590"

Alternatively you can join official Discord channel in order to find a group of players here. Description Under Lock is a survival horror game that will immerse you into the grim ambience of damnation. The players can take one of the two opposing roles: monster or survivor. The game is designed for 5 players. One of the players takes the role of the monster, whose goal is to mercilessly murder all the survivors. The other 4 players, in an attempt to survive, have to search for keys, which will eventually unlock an exit from the building. Since the keys and other items appear in random locations, each round on the same level will be unique what will keep you entertained for many hours. Moreover, the diversity of gameplay is achieved not only with random placement of items on the map, but also by completely different monsters, each of which has a unique hunting style and a separate set of skills. Play as a survivor As a survivor, your goal is to look for keys, that lead to the desired salvation. But one must remember, that not all keys lead to freedom. Some of the keys give access to other useful items. It is important to work as a team to achieve maximal efficiency against the monster, but do not forget the one main rule. The most important thing is to survive. Play as a monster Your goal is to exterminate all other players, but this cannot be done at the beginning. Scare the survivors first to become gain power which will unlock new abilities and eventually possibility to devour a victims. Currently two different monsters is available: Flatface is unable to move while someone looking at him, but it have set of abilities which allows him to disorient nearby survivors and perform unexpected attacks. Wheeper is unable to see survivors directly, however its set of abilities helps him to detect, track and hunt down survivors which are not careful enough. Shady is invisible until he gains enough strength, but still casts a shadow, and until then he is a harmless observer. VR support For people who are ready to truly challenge their mettle, Under Lock is available in VR. Now, when the boundaries of virtual reality are not clear, the monster is way scarier than you could imagine, it will follow your steps, startling you with every rustle. The monster is closer than it seems. It is almost here. Survivors in Under Lock can play in VR on the same server with non-VR players.","['English', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1279330/header.jpg?t=1653129900,,https://discord.gg/AFTuu9B,underlockgame@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,53,20,,10,0,Includes violence and gore.,0,0,0,0,Shakitum,Shakitum,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,LAN PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,LAN Co-op,Steam Achievements","Action,Indie,Early Access","Early Access,Co-op,Horror,Survival Horror,PvP,Indie,Action,Multiplayer,VR,Asymmetric VR,Atmospheric,Survival,Action RPG,Dark,3D,First-Person,Realistic,Supernatural,Thriller,Team-Based","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1279330/ss_eb850777832091e36a10c5b1620742a079f4ae32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653129900,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1279330/ss_629cf030fb63fc6321b6b131fda26cca82151fba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653129900,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1279330/ss_2b880e82654338ccc7a3c356226ee9fe19477878.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653129900,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1279330/ss_c81e7c090deef0a65ffa6f989cc8ab35261d851c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653129900,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1279330/ss_c8d0debc93d764f310f5bdb414cf3c764dca55d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653129900,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1279330/ss_6a888f24f3ebbc5cbc55ad493709a90c3451aad8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653129900,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1279330/ss_f23aad489ed27a4176420ccf2df94ad47103ed55.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653129900,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1279330/ss_d1f4568e7242bfb101c15e308447040c293883be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653129900","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256850173/movie_max.mp4?t=1630691626,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256797137/movie_max.mp4?t=1598017604"

1425330,Eye of the Beholder,"Nov 30, 2020",0 - 20000,0,0,0.0,0,0,"Step into war-torn enemy territory in this immersive VR game experience based on the Oscar-shortlisted documentary MY ENEMY, MY BROTHER (2015). EYE OF THE BEHOLDER is a 20 beta minute experience that subverts the war-game genre as players must choose to combat or collaborate with others. As a documentarian I am inspired by real life situations and stories and in 2014, I was lucky enough to meet two men whose story changed my life and that of many others. Zahed and Najah are former enemy soldiers who have become blood brothers for life. Zahed was an Iranian child soldier during the Iran-Iraq War when he found Najah, an enemy soldier, injured in a bunker. Zahed made a split-second decision in the heat of the battlefield and instead of shooting Najah, he risked his own life to save him. I was deeply inspired by Zahed's ability to recognize the humanity in his enemy. His act of bravery has had lasting ramifications in both their lives and those of their families. I documented their story in a film, MY ENEMY, MY BROTHER, which resonated strongly with audiences across the world. It landed on the Oscar shortlist, was nominated for an Emmy award, and premiered as a NYTimes OpDoc in 2015. The film evolved into a feature documentary, which premiered at Hot Docs Documentary Film Festival in 2017. The strong international response to the films, as well as feedback in the Q and A sessions, led us to explore the film’s core themes further. We wanted to bring the remarkable empathy that Najah and Zahed felt for one another into a unique space, where audiences would be able to step into their shoes and make choices for themselves, that could make them rethink their decisions in real life. We developed what is now the EYE OF THE BEHOLDER VR immersive experience. The EYE OF THE BEHOLDER VR subverts the war-game genre to explore how we judge one another as friend or foe. EYE OF THE BEHOLDER is set in a conflict zone, but in essence each decision reflects the kind of snap judgement made in school yards, street corners and board rooms across the globe. Do I trust this person? Are they friendly or a threat? Should I collaborate with this person or fight them? As the player faces each challenge in the bunker and decides whether or not to collaborate with the other soldiers, their decisions affect how the other soldier responds to them, and ultimately determines who makes it out alive. As the player discovers in the end, their decisions also impact the welfare of nearby communities.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/header.jpg?t=1607025308,,,mandy@fathomfilm.ca,True,False,False,0,,0,6,2,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Reptoid Games,Fathom Film Group,Single-player,"Adventure,Casual,Indie","Casual,Documentary,Cinematic,Singleplayer,Experimental,VR,First-Person,Education,Multiple Endings,Adventure,Indie,Choices Matter,Visual Novel,Choose Your Own Adventure,Character Action Game","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_74fef06971b6a0cc2a5dcd0c548f12265efe65f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_a8a0a735e101e8743f21ec1a090df8de02293a42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_7307be5ac5ae3118aafbae07094fd1b02859d0ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_6bfe747e20087584479b4bdc7d861b032be217dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_72a74febf38ac6b330698a3099299f5ffd7e8bf7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_0363899a532ba5cd51671e9fec31d0b6bcc674dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256801367/movie_max.mp4?t=1604429568

650700,Yume Nikki,"Jan 9, 2018",200000 - 500000,44,0,0.0,0,0,"An RPG Maker tour de force, and a divisively controversial work for fans. You are free to explore the various dream worlds at your own pace. If you check certain characters or items in the game you will collect an “Effect”. These “Effects” can be used to change the main character’s appearance. Some of these “Effects” have special actions or animations which you can activate by pressing 1 or 3 on the number pad. Yume Nikki is a very unique title that has become one of the most well-known indie games to come out of Japan. It is unlike any other RPG, especially in the fact that there really is no action or dialogue to speak of. This gives the game a very dark and foreboding atmosphere. Can you make it to the secret ending? There are no particular goals nor story of which to speak. You simply walk around. Checking certain characters inside the dream will increase the number of 'Effects'. Using 'Effects' will cause the main character's appearance to change. (During this time, you can use the 1 or 3 keys to implement special movements and effects.) Using the same 'Effect' a second time will cause the character to revert to their original form.

The sudden disappearance of a powerful dragon is the spring for a series of events that will plunge the whole Kingdom into chaos! Now it's up to you to either keep everyone in check and save the land or plunge the Kingdom into a pit of insanity. The Kingdom is the huge world you will be adventuring in, with more than 400 different maps and everything a RPG needs: cities, hidden dungeons, secret events laying around, and a lot(!) of NPCs! The final version of the game will have 20 Reigns (currently working on the 15th) fighting for supremacy, each one of them led by a Princess of a different race or with some unique features! There's currently more than 100000 possible looks for our characters, across 20+ different races! There's pregnancies in Princess &amp; Conquest , but that's not the only way to get more companions! You can also: find eggs laying around buy new companions from the goblins auctions conjure skeletons resurrect undeads into other living races transform everyone into rabbits and many more! While every Reign is granted to get theirs, many characters that you'll meet around the Kingdom are missing their own lineage of NPCs (called Progeny) and can't be bred yet, but we'll keep adding more as development continues! VN meets RPG meets Strategy in a world to travel on foot, boat, digging your way underground, diving or flying with wings on your back. A surprisingly phenomenal soundtrack! You will be humming our tunes for weeks... More than 100k possible looks for NPCs you can recruit and 'have fun' with. Beautiful CGs and pixel animations made by professionals in the hentai industry. Countless dialogues, scenes, events exploring the Kingdom's characters and its story. Unique mechanics (simulated pregnancies and genetics, breeding, slave auctions, necromancy, kingdom-wide corruption, transformations...) Constant updates and plenty more features to come!

Each small game within the anthology is a unique, standalone adventure that puts clever twists on every setting and format. PLEASE NOTE: These games do not contain any new content from their original versions. In Don't Escape , players find themselves in a remote cabin overlooking a tiny village. Before night falls, you'll need to find a way to effectively secure yourself inside the cabin, using everything at your disposal, in order to protect the townsfolk from yourself. Because when the full moon rises, you're not your best self... In Don't Escape 2 , you and your friend have barely suvived the undead ravaging your town, and must find a way to fortify the place you've holed up in before nightfall. Only problem is, the clock is ticking as you scour the surrounding countryside for supplies, and your friend isn't looking so great... In Don't Escape 3 , you awaken onboard a silent spaceship that holds a gruesome discovery. Without your memories, you need to find a way back home while unraveling the mystery of what happened to you and the crew, but are you really as alone as you think you are? Offering the top-notch atmosphere scriptwelder has become known for and creative puzzles and situations for you to overcome using logical problem solving skills, often with different solutions, the Don't Escape Trilogy is the perfect way to spend an evening with the lights turned down and the volume turned up. About the Developer: Poland-based developer Scriptwelder is a well known creator of creepy web-based games, perhaps the most iconic of which is the Deep Sleep series, which has won multiple awards and been played by millions all around the world. The Don't Escape series began as a web game in 2013 that inverted the classic escape-the-room formula... rather than trying to find a way out, players were instead trying to find a way to secure themselves within, usually from some sort of threat or danger.

The game is a three-part series set in the Middle Ages during the plague that spread from Italy to France and finally reached England. In Tales of the Black Death , you play as Baldasar, a young Italian boy. Part 1 : Tales of the Black Death – Italy Hunted by the death of his parents from an unknown illness, Baldasar becomes an outcast and finds solace in the companionship of a traveling thief. Together, they try to survive the unforgiving land populated with disease, bandits and death. Part 2 : Tales of the Black Death – France As the Black Death rages in Italy, Baldasar flees to France where a voice from the past warns him of the apocalyptic state of the known world. In his journey he will become the protector of a young French girl in search of her missing mother as they try to survive the unforgiving land and cross paths with desperate townsfolk, man-at-arms and death. Part 3 : Tales of the Black Death - England Having befriended two army deserters, Baldasar joins them in their journey until fate decides otherwise. Through cruel and unknown land, he reaches London at the height of the pandemic where he discovers a town ravaged by death and despair. Will he choose a path paved with goodness or turn his blade into a weapon of vengeance? A game of survival. While it’s important to eat from now and then, the game primarily tracks your health which is represented by infections, sickness and injury inflicting your characters. In the Middle Ages, it was common to die as a result of neglected an illness for too long. This is also the case in Tales of the Black Death. A game of morality. In addition to managing your health, injuries, malaise and infections, the game establishes its own morality landscape where the player has to make difficult choices.

'Labyrinth - Roll of Fate' is a first-person, turn-based horror roguelike inspired by classic board games. Your only hope of freedom lies in playing the Game Master’s twisted game and surviving his malevolent challenge. 'How will you escape?' Each turn, the dice decide your fate.

1382770,Knightczech: The beginning,"Oct 14, 2020",0 - 20000,0,0,14.99,0,0,"Knightczech is an adventurous 2D platformer in which the player explores various corners of kingdoms in Euritia world - from sun-drenched forests through the war-ravaged region to dark underworld. NOTICE: This game was not meant to be easy. It will challange your platformer skills even with it's simple movement &amp; level design. Only true veterans will be able to fully complete the game. The game currently has two different modes - 'Classic' mode and 'Story' mode. Classic mode: In classic mode, the player can dive into each of the three main areas of Euritia world in order to conquer the prepared challenges. The difficulty escalates along with progress to other levels of the area. Each of the areas has different types of dangers or traps. In this mode, your goal is to find and collect the long-lost swords of the Titans from ancient times in order to unlock more difficult levels. Remember, you have no special powers. It is just you, your sword and iron armor. Story mode: Storyline consists of levels that will take you through the main (but also secondary) areas of Euritia world. Your story begins in the middle of a war between two powerful kingdoms dominating Euritia. You are one of hundreds of ordinary soldiers for whom the whole war means only poverty, suffering and bloodshed. But everything will change after you, as one of the few, survive a crushing battle in enemy territory - this is the beginning of the struggle for survival and the search for a way to try to change the course of you life in an already destructive and long-lasting war. In this game mode, players have available features such as inventory, improving their character and abilities, merchants with items, hidden places with treasures, various enemy units including several major villains, character dialogues, storytelling and much more.

772470,8-in-1 IQ Scale Bundle,"Jan 5, 2018",0 - 20000,0,0,14.99,0,32,"We transform science into delightful games For decades, researchers have created tasks that measure cognitive abilities. We’ve adapted some of these tasks and made some of our own, creating cognitive games. It makes you smarter! Dual N-Back Dual N-Back proven, pass the learning results into another brain activity. This effect has been confirmed by a number of scientific studies. 'Fluid intelligence (Gf) refers to the ability to reason and to solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge. Gf is critical for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, and it is considered one of the most important factors in learning. Moreover, Gf is closely related to professional and educational success, especially in complex and demanding environments.' How To Start The Dual N-Back game field is a square separated to smaller squares with lines (like 3x3 cross-zero game field). During the game the image is shown in one of the game squares. Your task is to find a match of the current position of the image to the position shown one (or two) step earlier. If there was a match, press the corresponding match key. Same thing for the auditory letters. Just listen and try to remember the letters from the previous steps. Tips For Beginners There are some points you have to know to do the Dual N-Back task right. Here is a short list of tips for you to start: - do it at least 20 minutes a day (30-40 is better) to have significant results; - do it at least 5 days a week; - subvocalizing is bad; - chunking is not so bad; - if you get stuck on one level for two or three weeks don't worry, just keep going, but don't forget to: - push your limits. If you get 80% success rate on the task, move up to the next level. Don't try to stabilize a level you are already doing good. Going out of your comfort zone is the only way to grow. Real Life Benefits A lot of people report numerous benefits after doing the N-Back Task, such as: easier to get a hold of a discussion better verbal fluency faster reading with better understanding better concentration and focus better dream recall improvements in piano playing All these benefits (and there are many others) were taken from the real user feedback on the N-Back task training. Complex Working Memory (CWM) Complex Working Memory (CWM) is a brain training exercise that improves working memory and fluid intelligence. The current implementation is based on the task used for the study 'Expanding the mind’s workspace' by Jason M. Cheyne and Alexandra B. Morrison. In short, the study demonstrates the success in using the CWM task to improve working memory, cognitive control and understanding of what has been read. Overview The CWM exercise consists of the remembering rounds and the recall stage. The number of the rounds in an exercise equals to the current level of the CWM exercise. Every round in the CWM exercise consists of two parts: the Decision making part at the beginning and the Remembering part at the end. There are usually 4 Decision tasks in one round that are followed by an item to Remember. So, for example, it the exercise level is 5 you'll have to remember 5 items in total. After all rounds passed there is a Recall stage where you have to recall all the remembered items. There are two types of the CWM Span Task: Spatial CWM Verbal CWM The Decision and Remembering/Recall parts of the exercise are different for each type. Spatial CWM On the Decision stage of the Spatial CWM you'll have to make a decision whether the displayed figure is symmetric on the Y axis. (Symmetric means its left part is its mirrored reflection of the right part) Verbal CWM On the Decision stage of the Verbal CWM you'll have to make a decision whether the displayed characters form the correct word. If the word is spelled correctly press the Yes button (or correspondent key on the keyboard). If not - press No. On the Remembering stage of the Verbal CWM you are shown the alphabet letter. Remember the letter on every round. On the Recall stage you have to recall the letters in the order they appeared (by clicking the cells in the grid). Space Task Game aimed at improving an individual’s episodic memory. Episodic memory is the type of memory required when you have to remember where you parked your car in a multi-storey car park after going shopping for several hours or where you left your keys in home several hours ago, for example. It is one of the facets of cognitive functioning. Schulte table The Schulte table is one of the most effective exercises for developing the brain, attention, concentration, speeding up the visual search. Also this exercise is the most popular exercise for the development of speed reading. Schulte tables usually consist of randomly arranged numbers. The number of cells in the tables is also different and most often they are the size of 5x5 elements. Anagrams Anagrams very well develop thinking, speed reading and speed of thought. The main thing is to find as many true anagrams as possible for the time set in the game. Mental Math Mental Math is a brain game for testing / improving your mental skill calculations. We do calculations in the mind and improve your attention, working memory and processing speed. Corsi Exercises Corsi is the implementation of the Corsi Block-Tapping test. Corsi Block-Tapping is a variant of the memory task. It was originally based on the Digit Span task, but unlike Digit Span, it requires the use of visuo-spatial memory. The process of the Corsi block tapping task requires the subject to observe the sequence of blocks, and then repeat the sequence back in order. The task starts with a small number of blocks and gradually increases in length up. The test measures both the number of correct sequences and the longest sequence remembered. This number is known as the Corsi Span, and averages about 5 for normal human subjects. An fMRI study involving subjects undergoing this test revealed that while the sequence length increases, general brain activity remains the same. So while humans may show encoding difficulty, this is not related to overall brain activation. Whether able to perform the task well or not the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is highly involved. Corsi blocks tasks with a normal forward order requires support from the visuospatial skech pad, but not from the phonological loop. When the sequence to be recalled becomes longer than three or four items, central executive resources are used. Fastest Fastest is a reaction rate test. Knowing your reaction speed, it can always be compared with other people. This is necessary in order to properly organize their training. If suddenly the reaction rate began to fall, then urgently increase the number of exercises to improve the reaction speed. You may not notice how fast the reaction starts to fall. This often happens with many athletes. Look, a huge number of athletes performed with success, and then somehow slipped unnoticed to bad results. And no one can understand what happened. It seems that the physical form is good, but there are no results.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Russian', 'Thai', 'Turkish', 'Japanese', 'Portuguese - Brazil']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/header.jpg?t=1528522878,,https://vk.com/id17456248,alexgreendev@gmail.com,True,True,True,0,,0,55,11,,2,0,,55,0,87,0,ALEKSANDER CHEPAIKIN,ALEKSANDER CHEPAIKIN,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Stats,Steam Leaderboards",Indie,"Indie,Puzzle","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/ss_8bdda74c140f1df5801e2c3c15a408315b57a184.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528522878,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/ss_98f841bbb5bce8d7efcbcd29cb0e8d3028e15ddb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528522878,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/ss_1270710fc649c924ae934d49f5339022df75a10d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528522878,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/ss_43680b081074374358a41d9ce7ba33cf851dc082.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528522878,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/ss_57fac03362531d624c92826f4203f4d973fe8870.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528522878,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/ss_1a03e4267e5727f30c0e0783f153f70165a10094.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528522878,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/ss_1b3b87841c9fb2fd4489057dbefd86937e94c978.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528522878,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/ss_5c95b0b64adde9af3f3fcc820d8b7fd5c292702c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528522878,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/ss_ad3380a168986f7bc398e4f9b962a29192816ecb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528522878,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/ss_26edf8611bce7aca3c412c5b106fc8b56373039e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528522878,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/772470/ss_26e702705e00bcefb610845f43140cb2d4d038be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528522878","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256715281/movie_max.mp4?t=1527096303,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256717304/movie_max.mp4?t=1527096314"

But forget everything you know about other flight sims and flying games. IT CAN'T HELP YOU HERE! Key Features - Rather than telling your plane to go up/down/left/right, you control INDIVIDUAL air deflectors, and the sum of their generated torque is the result. - This means that although the controls are harder to learn, a master pilot can pull off very tight aerobatic stunts and emergency recovery manoeuvres. - Procedurally-generated world that gets more difficult as you collect more rings. - Interwoven and deep game mechanics -- slide to boost, boost through rings or slide during a boost to refuel, tuck to magnetize wings and slide easier and double engine thrust and decrease drag, and that's just the start! - Tight controls are simple to learn, but challenging to master. Being good at stratO is something to be _proud_ of. - PC Version supports keyboard controls, XBOX Controllers (with vibration) and generic gamepads/flight sticks - All controls are remappable (including menu &amp; interface navigation) Other Features - Flightstick users can press+hold on the main control menu button(The one with the star on it for 3 sec) to toggle the game to pitch/yaw/roll controls - Alternate colour scheme for airplane &amp; orientation indicators for players with Deuteranopia",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/header.jpg?t=1452543516,http://www.flystrato.com,http://steamcommunity.com/groups/stratoGame,,True,False,False,0,,0,50,9,,13,0,,298,0,298,0,Mark Chong,Mark Chong,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Indie,Simulation","Indie,Simulation,Action,Flight","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_a550e4392ad6db516aa51be92724920774e01e9d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_e747fc346b6bf54edc35e80dec7dea45102662ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_ef00817a6b66d99a980d9c1fd3933c87f3ddaa6c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_b10316717c0d6816c1a7ff9cc3eaef01543db8d6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_1b427af2d968a5167ceda2a3fab18fad9582c0bc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_42d4a68793f222e0eb2d4aec91462ca1d1fccf0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_5c6defe68ff8a8d58ce9617e791b7446366e67d9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_e640a7fef75000e9a7a1f5ce52f97ec44eea3e9a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_59ba275de215bacc77070da30e77227bb1ba365f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_7bb0535a70e067a804fda38fa70f1387254880cd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_abdc8b969ac5d27bd17ce05a5eb89fd83197ca05.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_bb4757ab20fce1230d28df661dbe0d48dc469049.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_13fd26c139d83dc452b85ef398c4e272c3d0dfd5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_3ee6febf96aef911b04d1556e6fa3609f58fbd93.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_a01643fe632c296084dc33f417a3eab470236622.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_cdd8d3cd32c0a8b6ff156df61c4785a96c90e3cd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341680/ss_aa71c9fd48675e1fde2533ebed289e661074ef45.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452543516","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256659681/movie_max.mp4?t=1452543507,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256655714/movie_max.mp4?t=1447377611,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256655401/movie_max.mp4?t=1447377439"

Key Of Impasse is not a game with a long game duration. The original purpose of making this game is to provide offline experience with VR. Therefore, the decryption time of the game has a limit of 30 minutes. However, personally, a 30-minute experience is not enough to complete all decryption, maybe you need a second, third or more ; The game also provides a random password function, which is the player's password and even the placement of items in the secret room after the player re-enters the game. It will be different from the previous game.

The pursuit of happiness, the escape from pain is everything to me. There is no level at all. It's a person who is daydreaming all day and thinks the dream is pretty good. For me, the game is my second life.... I play all kinds of games, but I'm always annoyed by the wonderful stories of some works, and I get angry even when I'm unhappy,Then in order to vent their anger began to deliberately play games, while facing the NPC and cruel scourge while thinking about if the story is my own to do good..... Originally, I have lived such a life without doubt for myself until..... One day I had a dream. I had a very sad love story. It was only a dream, but I felt very sad. So I remembered the dream and thought it was a love story of the world..... But when I saw the story again, I found that it couldn't be any more common, and why was it that I was so unhappy and annoyed?! I don't understand... After that, it took root in my heart like a seed. The longer it grew, the more I grew unhappy...... Then I found that I regret only exist in my actor dream, when I woke up I'll no longer be a hero, so this love story will become intense darkness without light in my eyes. Having understood all this, I began to hate myself for being so unhappy and hating myself as a keyboard player. Finally, I opened the software, made this little game to taunt myself, and wanted it to stay on the platform that the player knew all the time,That way I can think of all this humiliation and live a happier life. Main slot points: [small place] [press F5 to adjust the size of the game window] 1. you are a full level of the brave, please don't use their own skills to kill the brave [] Dutch act. 2., the main line is very free, you can finish the story first, then go to the task, there is a new dialogue, But I suggest you go or go to those towns stroll, bubble sister, buy a bottle of blood what. 3. novice tutorial maze, there are four or five treasure boxes, remember to take. 4. Elven village needs to be defeated after a BOSS and is eligible for entry, The hidden role of the two floor of the village head needs dialogue with the head of the village before repetition occurs. 5. pub just singing diva money pit, will give you a bonus BUFF. 6., even if you buy jewelry in the jewelry store, you can not equip, because you bring the protagonist aura. 7. likewise, all the shields you gain are not equipped, because you do not hold shields. 8. please do not try to flirt with the game, otherwise you will only keep GAME OVER. 9. [important] a world chosen to change. There are three choices for the four heavenly kings: 1. test selection is the world of testing The world is an unfinished test phase of the world, with only one ending. Except for BUG, All aspects are very pit father! The map has not been completed, the various plots have no follow-up, and the battle is very pit. 2., the selection of the devil becomes a formal world, please play this The two worlds, except maps, are all different settings. The devil's world has a more complete map, more characters and plots, and more props and treasure chests. You can also learn all kinds of magic and skills, and the heroine's plot is more, and there are not as many as fifteen characters. Among them, there are Raiders of cute boys and not dirty Story 0 The world's monsters are completely different from the world of testing, becoming a hit. And the world's various scenarios are free to choose, you can first complete the task, and then pick up the task, No matter how you play, each will have a new plot dialogue. Of course, the ending is more. And there are hidden allies who can help you defeat the final BOSS. 3. choosing a farm is a world of real endings, but you have to get two signals to get in. Testers, the world and the devil, choose the world to get through, will get a password.

Manage a business as its CEO, making sure not only to see the company survives but also that you become wealthy as well. Expand your reach across the globe, both to get access to new customers but also to take advantage of the different regional advantages, transporting your goods by land or sea. Produce resources and products, from simple items like fruit to complex items like cars which require production chains and skilled workers to produce. Research not only how to make other products, but how to improve them beyond their most basic into something much more valuable. Design your product lines with custom properties such as the level of luxury or the level of complexity, making them harder to produce but worth much more to potential customers. Specialize offices for each region to focus on research, finding new customers, or cutting operating expense. Global Fortune is still in Early Access. That means for the foreseeable future it will continue to be under development. We will continue updating it, adding new features, and balancing things as best we can.

Dream Quest is a roguelike deckbuilding game inspired by the likes of Ascension, Magic: the Gathering, and Shandalar. Explore randomly generated levels as one of 13 classes in short, 30 minute, sessions. One floor might find your wizard in the crypt, another your warrior underwater, and a third, your assassin stalking a volcanic wasteland. As you progress, your characters earn achievements, each making your future runs a little easier or more interesting. Combat is a card game. Your abilities are a deck of cards that you develop as you gain power. For example, a thief starts with a handful of Slice cards and a Backstab, but can learn defensive moves like Dodge or powerful finishing moves like Coup de Grace. Carefully choosing which cards to add to your deck is the heart of the game: wise choices will find you slicing through monsters while poor ones will leave you tripping over your own two feet. Features: 13 different classes, with wildly different play styles Over 300 cards, ranging from the defensive Kick and Armor to the devastating Meteor and Curse of Doom More than 70 monsters carefully catalogued in the Bestiary as you encounter them Infinite replayability – easily 50 hours to see the majority of the content No In App Purchases – the price of the game is the price of the game.

Can you construct a ‘bridge’ which will guide a vehicle propelled only by repulsor beams? What if it’s far above where you start? Or when there isn’t enough time and you have to launch it at the exit? Sometimes the answer is careful planning and sometimes brute force. Is the game easy? Nope, but that’s the point. Return to a time when games were sometimes difficult, completing them took effort, and that feeling of accomplishment and relief when a crazy idea works. Challenges? Need to slow it down or speed it up? Pick the game mode that fits your style. Want to make the perfect bridge without a time limit? The ‘lowest node count’ mode should match your needs 70+ levels Play any level at any time. No required progression or need to complete a level before moving on. Some levels will focus on a specific skill, other take a little more 'creativity'. Why the '+'? No separate level packs to buy or DLC. Any additions will be available to everyone without having to buy 'extras'. Tech Features: Want to use your XBox controller? Enjoy. 4k, unusual resolution scales and multi-monitor ready! Have a high refresh rate monitor? The game's 500fps cap should be plenty. Customizable RGBA User Interface Multi-core support with user selectable options to best fit your needs.

He seeks revenge and heads out to battle the spirits of the forest. Go Farm IV (Management) This is a farm managing game with 3 different modes: Classic,Survival and Freeplay. These unique modes offer different experiences that will change the way you farm. Classic mode has a bar that has to be kept up by having activity on your farm such as your animals running around or general harvesting. Survival adds a scoring system and makes the game unbeatable but will show your score when the farming ends. Free play gives you all the time in the world as there is no way to fail and even gives you a free bunny! Pooper (Flight) Fly in the sky with nothing but the thrust from your rears nugget maker and see how far you can get, but dont forget to eat or your tummy will empty and you will drop out of the sky like one of your many poops. Vermillion (Beat Em Up) Your family was taken from right in front of your eyes by disappearing shadow goblins but what they do not know is that this little red yeti will not stand for it. Time to beat through the shadow ridden creatures and defeat them at their core. Day Dream Adventure (Fighting/Adventure) Day dreaming is awesome, you can find yourself in some pretty wacky places fighting many creatures wearing some crazy battle gear. This game creates a random adventure that changes as your character grows stronger. Sandwich VS Bagel (Fighting) Free bagels day is great ... as long as you do not have a bagel king in your path. This game has you fighting your way past a bagel king to finally get the free bagel you wanted all this time. Orb Looting (Looting) How many orbs can you grab before the timer runs out? hopefully more than foe can. Each round of collecting get harder and faster as the game goes on but if you find it too easy then why not battle head to head with a friend and play multiplayer to see who can loot the most. Pooper Deluxe (Flight) Take to the sky once again but with more control and power ups that can help you fly faster and further than before! Up to 4 players will have you and all your friends racing to grab all the foods to fill your tummy's and gain powers from the special items that will help your flight and score.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/814710/header.jpg?t=1572998754,,,rhys510games@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,3,1,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Rhys510,Rhys510,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Shared/Split Screen,Remote Play Together","Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie","Action,Adventure,Indie,Casual","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/814710/ss_1c0433e37a17bb0b2f0612fb26c98b5665c914ea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572998754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/814710/ss_b9c952dcad5f73a1cf17d9f9f96181f19ac2e2d9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572998754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/814710/ss_b9ff6496a468f7d814cf58d7897b65564090b2cd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572998754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/814710/ss_520fdb7457050f68c739d36a572a3fd36e93ec31.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572998754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/814710/ss_e366cba2b7366ae5ad80df463ebd4d35428c57cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572998754,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/814710/ss_d63a03acdc56b66c6c7095b62ff2eb75295bf55f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572998754",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256709849/movie_max.mp4?t=1519763062

1633370,Boat Crew,"Aug 1, 2022",0 - 20000,2,0,15.99,0,0,"Boat Crew Boat Crew is an action-packed singleplayer game that is all about leading your men to bring out the best in them in the field of battle. You're given charge of a PT boat, one of many, in the Pacific, and sent against the Imperial Japanese Navy in the forefront of the Pacific War. Sometimes through bravery and sometimes through guile, you'll take on ever stronger enemy forces and come out on top. Manage your people and your resources; beg, borrow, and steal, and equip yourself from a wide variety of tools available to bring your campaign to a victorious conclusion. Prioritize your acquisitions, make connections, and customize your ship's capabilities to your taste. Above all else, care for your crew; Experienced sailors are in short supply in the largest naval front in the history of mankind. Sometimes the best option is to live to fight another day. Key Features Crew Management: In Boat Crew, you are not the boat herself but her commander, with all the associated responsibilities and privileges. Most tasks will be delegated to your trusty crewmen, and it's up to you to make sure they're up to the task. Jury-Rigged: With distances vast and ships spread thin, you're afforded a substantial degree of autonomy. Anti-tank guns and light mortars are only some of the weapons you can add to your boat that would be considered unusual, and there is ample room for innovation. The only two rules are, make sure you are still floating, and get the job done! Tested in Battle: Training teaches a man to keep his head down, but its experience that teaches him when he can start handing out the hurt. Crack troops are far more lethal than green recruits, and will be capable of abilities otherwise unavailable to less experienced crewmen. Live and Teach: Beyond being good fighters, your veterans also have much to teach to their replacements. Experienced soldiers will set a baseline crew experience and will impart their lethality on any replacements given some time. Fortunes of War: War has luck of its own, and industrialized total war is a different story entirely. Despite all caution and planning, some of your most trusted members will be lost at some point. It's up to you and your skills as the commander to find appropriate replacements and train them in time for larger engagements. Applied Science: Few things inspire innovation as much as war does, and sometimes you may find yourself pressed to be the first to employ a new technology in the field. Following the expansive tech tree will dramatically improve your crew's combat prowess; just make sure to prioritize appropriately. Grand Campaign: Fight numerous surface actions that range from night raids and coastal fire support to search and destroy. Your success in these battles will improve your clout and your crew's experience, increasing the options available to you in future battles and providing more daring operations.

Just don't get caught. HAVE YOU GOT NERVES OF STEEL? 1-4 player online co-op Take control of up to 4 cult members in this unique online co-op experience where you must work together to stop possessed cultists dead set on taking you to hell with them. Single player mode For hardcore players only. In this mode, you'll be doing all the screaming yourself. Challenging gameplay No two DEVOUR playthroughs are ever the same. To stop the evil, you’ll need a focused team and perfect execution, with a single session lasting up to an hour. CAN YOU BANISH EVIL TOGETHER? Each themed DEVOUR map not only brings a terrifying new manifestation of the goat demon Azazel, but also completely new environments to explore, items to collect, fiends to overcome, and forbidden rituals to perform. Exorcise the demonically possessed Your goal is to break Azazel's hold on the cultists. On each map, work together in a race against time to find key ritual items – some of which might be alive and unwilling - to complete the banishment. Escalating difficulty Each possessed cultist’s rage and speed increases as the game progresses, as does the number of fiends they spawn to stop you. Your only means of defence is your UV flashlight. Replayability Locked doors, ritual objects and item spawns are randomized, ensuring that no two games are the same. What's more, DEVOUR's unpredictable AI ups the game, making you second guess each and every move. Player progression Players earn experience with each playthrough, increasing their Cult Rank and earning Ritual Tokens. These are used to unlock valuable Perks, which can mean the difference between living to banish another demon or an agonizing death. Nightmare mode Beat the game without breaking a sweat? Try Nightmare mode for the ultimate challenge. Multiplayer features Make use of our in-game positional voice chat. Bring friends, or find other players using the server browser.

2189750,Mission: Aliens,"Nov 4, 2022",0 - 20000,0,0,0.59,0,0,"Sergeant, last night we received a signal that an unknown aircraft of extraterrestrial origin had crashed in the taiga. The locals assured us that at the crash site they observed five creatures very similar to humans, only with gray skin and large almond-shaped eyes. When our group arrived there, the flying saucer and the humanoids were no longer there. The locals said that a group of people and a lot of military equipment quickly arrived on the site, they collected every shard of it and fled. Only Professor Stearns, an ex-military man who is serious about the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, could have done this. If they fall into his hands and he begins to use them for his own selfish purposes, then surely irreparable things will happen on Earth. Your task is to sneak into the base, to eliminate all the guards and release our brothers in mind. Then you'll just have to leave the territory of the base and return to headquarters. Is that clear? Execute. The main mission of the game is to release five aliens that are locked in cells, and to release them each cell needs an individual key. The key to the first cell is somewhere in the base (sector 3), having found it, you can save the first alien who is in cell #1. All subsequent keys will be in places where the aliens are imprisoned. After you save everyone, you need to get to the exit and save yourself. The entire base has a maze-like layout, which is guarded by armed guards. By eliminating one of the guards, you can take his weapons for yourself. The map also has medicines to help you replenish your health and ammo for your weapons. To avoid getting lost in the labyrinth, use the signs that indicate the block numbers.

The existing defense genre games had 2D graphics and 3D graphics, but they all had something in common that they eventually faced enemies crawling on the floor. But 'Infinite Cube Defense' will completely break your experiences. To catch not only distant cubes, but also rain-pouring cubes just above your head, you have to precisely control your mouse to target your enemies or use mini guns, rifles, shotguns, snipers, and even missile launchers and various turrets properly. Don't be relieved that your enemy dies from a bullet or two. They become strong so slowly that you can't notice it, but it's a number that can never be ignored. As long as your computer holds out, infinite pouring cubes are aiming at your head. Don't panic when you start the game and remember these three things. 1. Trapped in an unknown space and you are alone! 2. Try to survive the longest! 3. Defeat the ever-increasing variety of cubes, collect money, items, and points, and make proper use of your weapons! Features -Unlike existing defense games, cubes are created in three dimensions. -9 unique weapons and tools. - Monsters that are constantly being created without ending -The score is automatically saved and the ranking is recorded, so you can enjoy a round easily. ------------------------------------------------------------ Move: W,A,S,D Shoot Gun: Mouse Left Click Change Gun Type: Mouse ScrollWheel or Key Board 1~9 Buy Amo: Q Zoom In &amp; Out: Left Shift + Mouse ScrollWheel ------------------------------------------------------------",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1723400/header.jpg?t=1634047266,,,abyssrift.resident@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,2,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Abyss Rift,Abyss Rift,Single-player,Indie,"3D,Singleplayer,Action,Arcade,Top-Down Shooter,Physics,PvE,Indie,Shooter,Top-Down","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1723400/ss_0c50d045da99c4082f930b44979dccb2a624421a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1634047266,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1723400/ss_e9a2da6cad91c66f60859c5334155ff58064009a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1634047266,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1723400/ss_cbbddaba158d0c0406b1f17c21b18799b0493136.1920x1080.jpg?t=1634047266,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1723400/ss_c327b1a8312fb432eea998375056ac1e825e085d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1634047266,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1723400/ss_1063375e209b6340bebac3720e580356d9109f2c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1634047266",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256850227/movie_max.mp4?t=1631269050

All he can find is a dumbass too horny for his own good, and a weirdo who can't get over his strange fetish for lizard-humanoid creatures.

2069540,Opalescence,"Aug 5, 2022",0 - 20000,0,0,6.99,0,0,"Opalescence is a colorful arcade-style top-down shooter in which you collect points and fight and avoid enemies to get a high score. Goal: play, earn points, get high score, buy upgrades, repeat Opalescence: A chromatic effect, commonly found in opal, in which colors reflected off an object depend on viewing angle Opalescence is a colorful bullet-hell in which you collect points, fight enemies, and dodge to get a high score. Four Main Game Modes: Though it can change in some missions, the goal of the game is usually quite simple; Collect Points, And Survive. Points are the colorful small pellets that appear around the map. Getting a point changes your color and keeps your light from fading. Tutorial In this game mode, you will learn the basics of the game though a series of a few short missions. Standard In Standard, you try to consistently beat your best score with in the using the game's standard rule set. The challenge gets harder as you go. But with your laser, your cannon, and power-ups, you can probably survive... for a while. Get the highest score you can! Missions Much like the tutorial mode, in Missions, you have specific tasks to complete. This time, they will require much more quick-thinking, dexterity, and reaction time. Finish each mission with as many points as possible or in the shortest amount of time to get that high score! Challenge You pick and choose modifications to the standard rule-set to make the game harder (or easier). By making the game harder, you can increase how many points you can earn. How many lives you start with, how quickly your light fades, and how fast you move are all up to you in this mode! Entity Types: Player The colorful colorful crescent-shaped entity that you control. To defend yourself, you can shoot your canon (left-mouse-button or left-bumper on controller), shoot a laser (right-mouse-button, or right-bumper on controller), drop bombs, or you can simply dodge. Chaser The Chaser is the most common enemy type. They are the black triangles which follow you. If they touch you, you will explode. They come in different sizes, the smaller they are, the faster, but they will also have less health. Chasers have a pretty low amount of health, but if several corner you, things can get dicey. If you make a Chasers collide with another enemy type, they will damage and potentially kill it. Given their low health, making to Chasers collide almost always kills both of them Shooter The Shooter is the second most common enemy. They are diamond-shaped stationary enemies. Instead of moving, they launch missiles at you. The missiles just move in a straight line so they are pretty easy to dodge on their own. Just like chasers, missiles will damage other enemies they collide with. Eater The Eater looks like an eight-sided star largest of all enemy-types. Eaters are resilient enemies, having the highest health. On top of that, they are immune to the canon. Only lasers and bombs will kill them. Eaters aren't stationary like the Shooters, but also don't follow you like the Chasers, instead, they always move toward the closest point until they touch and destroy it. They repeat this until they are destroyed Controls: Both controller, and keyboard and mouse are supported. Action; Controls Moving Through UI Elements; WASD Keys, Arrow Keys, or left control stick, or Mouse. Pressing UI Buttons Enter/Return; Space-Bar, Controller A Button, or Left Mouse Button (when hovering over) Going back a page in the UI; Escape Key, or Controller B button Moving Character; WASD Keys, Arrow Keys, or left control stick Aiming Canon and Laser; Mouse Cursor, or Left Control Stick Dropping a bomb; E Key, or Controller X Button Pause; Escape Key or Controller Start Button Full-screen toggle; F11 Go to next song; V Powerups: In all but a few missions and tutorials, large (mostly) colorful capsules will appear. These are called Power-Ups. They come in quite a few different flavors, and can be distinguished by their color and most have a icon on them. You collect them as you do points, (simply running into them). When you do collect a Power-up you will be granted a certain ability or have one of your stats changed in a positive way. Each power-up changes you in a unique way, and their effects are as follows: Power-Up Name; Effect Barrage; Makes you shoot your canon much faster, unleashing a barrage of pellets on your enemies Bombastic; Gives infinite bombs for a short period of time Bullet Time; Slows down time itself, but slows the player down less than everything else Gravity Well; Expands the gravity of the player, making it so that points and power-ups will be attracted from a much larger distance Incendiary; Makes the players canon shoot much larger, faster and more damaging pellets.

944650,The Mysteries of Baroque,"Sep 20, 2018",0 - 20000,0,0,4.99,0,0,"Mad science raised you from the dead! Pursue justice or vengeance, love or secrets, as you save or destroy the world with forbidden eldritch power. The Mysteries of Baroque is a 200,000-word interactive Gothic horror novel by William Brown, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. One dark and stormy night in a remote castle in the mountains, you awake anew, resurrected by the brilliant Dr. Holofernes. But even a mad scientist can't keep you alive forever. As the procedure reverses itself over time, you will begin to die again. You must fight to stay alive long enough hunt down your killers, avenge yourself, and protect the ones you love. Operating out of the mysterious Grand Guignol Theater, your quest will take you through the darkest shadows of the city of Baroque, the City of Dreadful Night, from its vast subterranean slums to the opulent mansions of its jaded, debauched aristocracy. Will you lose yourself in the distractions of romance, assure your own survival through the Holofernes Procedure, or sacrifice everything to take your revenge? Play as male, female, or non-binary; gay, straight, or ace. Fight to reclaim your old life and identity – or make a new home for yourself in the Grand Guignol Theater Trade your soul to a dark god in return for vengeance – or reject its help and fight alone. Stalk your killers through the glittering demimonde, mansions, and the slums. Learn the sanity-blasting secrets of the occult and risk your mind by unleashing them on your enemies. Use the power of science to devise and build bizarre inventions: death rays, gliders, and hallucinogenic grenades. Augment your regenerating body with clockwork technology like wings, a camera eye, or steel claws. Uphold the forces of law and order, the revolutionary Worker’s Council, or the enigmatic Vendetta faction in the battle for Baroque’s soul. Embark on dream quests and night visions to learn new skills and uncover ancestral memories. Bring comfort and hope to the suffering citizens of Baroque, or drive them further into darkness in pursuit of vengeance. You died betrayed. You died in pain. And your troubles are just beginning.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944650/header.jpg?t=1538610354,,https://www.choiceofgames.com/contact-us/,support-baroque-steam@choiceofgames.com,True,True,True,0,,0,16,3,,49,0,,0,0,0,0,Choice of Games,Choice of Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Indie,Adventure,RPG,Choose Your Own Adventure,Text-Based","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944650/ss_9219d11be1be408fcb8c9a4c43d9b393e91f75bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1538610354,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944650/ss_b1151bfa2d6b792371df3916de68be0ff63cad1a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1538610354,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944650/ss_dd4344cbabe5a242c52841c7bb634010dafebe2b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1538610354,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944650/ss_ffbc0f4ce100d63a73a0dab379fad1ca7fd32d84.1920x1080.jpg?t=1538610354,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944650/ss_323f1477dd68440ce342b99f5644242d45b81b7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1538610354",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256728725/movie_max.mp4?t=1537456919

You have to go through the first part of the game. You travel from city to city because you are not used to staying in one place. While working at a gas station, you come across a newspaper with a vacancy announcement for the position of a security guard, and by dialing the number, you were asked several questions. Only one point was important - are you ready to follow the rules and perform the tasks? You were not interested in the details, because you did not plan to stay in this place. The only thing that interested you was the payment and bonuses for the night shift. You don’t have much to choose from, and you have only the military service as an experience. Because of your hot-tempered personality, it was difficult for you to linger on past jobs. It was not easy to find the place, because it was hidden far from the nearest settlement. Night, bad weather, lack of good visibility, and you turned onto the wrong road. Precious time is lost. You didn’t find anyone at the founded location and decided to call the intercom. The voice was not very friendly. After receiving the entry code and instructions on where to go next, you get to the meeting place with your employer. The action of the game begins in the elevator. It’s your first day at a new job, you’re a little worried that you’re late. Forgot to read the instructions you received in the mail. Thoughts appeared in my head about how to fix this situation. The elevator doors have opened in front of you, and behind them is a man who is extremely passionate about something. The attempt to start a conversation failed and there was an awkward pause. A siren sounded. You were reminded of the instructions that you didn’t have time to read, and it probably contains important information. Well, nothing, we’ll figure it out on the spot, and you won’t get used to it. You have a strange feeling that the whole situation is extremely strange. As soon as you want to take up your duties, mysterious things begin to happen that frighten… What’s going on here? This is not the job I was hoping for at all, but what if I fell for a trick? You have to find out because the further you go, the more things are starting to get out of control.....

1808620,Dragon Evo,"Feb 27, 2022",0 - 20000,3,0,9.99,0,0,"Dragon Evo is a strategic card game inspired by RPGs, set in our own fantasy universe. Collect over 300 different cards and 9 different heroes. Enjoy full cross-platform matchups against unknown players or gather your friends and build your own clan! Set up and equip your favorite deck combined with specialized building cards to support your tactics. Utilize the special abilities of your hero card playing to the strengths of one of three factions to turn the battle in your favor, but beware - the lands in the Dragon Evo fantasy universe may turn out surprise you with its game changing event cards ! Full cross-platform matchups Play matches in ranked or unranked multiplayer modes - against your friends or random opponents across all supported platforms. Test your decks in single player modes or experience the exciting story of Dragon Evo in one of the two single player modes: campaign or adventure ! Dragon Evo is a unique tactical card game blending a touch of RTS with the thrill of RPGs and the best of deck building games . With our favorite elements from role playing , strategy and deck building / card games , it's a game like no other - a truly unique experience spanning across genres. Managing your available resources is an important part of the battle game. Moving cards around the board and using card actions cost you either gold, action points or both, making it vital to keep your resource supplies stocked! Not content with a rock-paper-scissors approach to health points and actions, your card attacks come in one of four different categories - close combat, ranged, flying or burrowing attacks - each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Mastering them and knowing how to counter them is what makes the winners winners. In addition to cards generating gold and action points, special building cards affect your and your opponents resources, bringing an extra strategic dimension. Stealing or destroying your opponents resource supply can be just as effective as taking out their cards, and bringing down one of their buildings can turn a flawless strategy to a mindless loss! Pick up equipment cards throughout the game to enhance and extend your deck beyond your playable cards. As you progress through the game you'll encounter new and more powerful equipment card requiring you to level up your cards to be strong enough. Equip your deck with powerful or creative item cards to make decks noone ever seen before, or turn the battle with just the right action card. We're huge fans of deck builders and card games, and we're bringing our favourite parts of both genres to Dragon Evo. Create a deck of 15 cards plus your hero card, equip it with equipment cards and bring it to the board. With your entire deck available to play at the beginning of each match, timing card plays and chaining effects and planning to execute your tactics is crucial to winning, with many card actions dependent on each other to succeed. With tens of different event cards that may be played at any time during the game, no two games are the same! Pick one of your unlocked event cards at the start of the match - will you choose an event that will be devastating to your opponents tactics or one that nudges the game in your favour? And which card did the opponent choose? Each faction in the DragonEvo universe has their own set of specializations, taking advantage of one type of actions, and being more or less vulnerable to different tactics. The military machine that is the mighty Rutai Empire specializes in powerful up-close combat . Seemingly overpowering, taking down the empire will take more than simple numbers. Fighting the Rutai empire any chance they get, the Hologev resistance specializes in ranged actions . Not as powerful as the Rutai, but hard to counter - the Hologev is a newcomer favourite! Once the ruling faction, guardians of peace and equality, the Highwinds has since been overthrown by the Empire. With their vast range of different action types , knowing how to play - and how to counter - the Highwinds is an exercise in creativity. Hard to master, but equally hard to play against. Progressing through the game, you unlock new capabilities and cards that you may find in your card packs - cards to be used in-game, to equip your deck, event cards or even building cards! Knowing your opponents will be on the hunt for that killer card combination, upgrading and unlocking new cards and equipment is key to staying ahead! Each game you play earns you a card pack with several new cards you can use to either upgrade your existing cards, enhance your deck, or even create entire new card decks. Winner packs will give you better rewards, but do your best and even a loss can turn into a bonus! Play, don't spend Our unique in-game card progression and level-up system is linked directly to played games - play to unlock additional content as you get stronger and more experienced. Dragon Evo will never contain microtransactions or ways to pay for in-game bonuses - no more pay to win! As you collect more cards, you'll realize that some cards are weaker than others, even of the same type. Use them to upgrade your best cards to become even more powerful! Combine existing cards of the same type and pay the upgrade cost to upgrade your cards and unlock new equipment or just become stronger, making it even more satisfying to crush your opponents.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1808620/header.jpg?t=1649075922,,https://bromanticgames.com/support,support@bromanticgames.com,True,False,True,0,,0,6,3,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Bromantic Games,Bromantic Games,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Stats","Casual,Indie,RPG,Strategy,Early Access","Early Access,Card Game,Dragons,Deckbuilding,Strategy,Story Rich,Turn-Based Tactics,Tactical,Card Battler,Trading Card Game,PvE,PvP,Tutorial,Turn-Based Strategy,Board Game,Female Protagonist,RPG,2D,Top-Down,Turn-Based Combat","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1808620/ss_37397f1a0a6e401cc043c7e1e1823f94643ed573.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649075922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1808620/ss_c6d3d91f6afae2cd258e3e2f1659dccfe507c60d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649075922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1808620/ss_cb166c3ab069a9ba3cba0e5f8192b108734d3c4d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649075922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1808620/ss_8e6049d16110d509bbf855f12de9a306f2d3aafc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649075922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1808620/ss_738036e05cd9c1a5d14ecc920076f508411fafc5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649075922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1808620/ss_3a72a4e737939a3e5ac35657b0e8ea67a4687144.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649075922,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1808620/ss_7d27b7da539f23478b13bbc0e5919b7fae44cac4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649075922",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256858589/movie_max.mp4?t=1636188121

The game was developed as a high school project by Griffon Hanson and Ty Morrow, and it won 7th place in the Computer Game &amp; Simulation Programming event at the 2021 FBLA National Leadership Conference. Everything the player sees is in black and white, but throughout the levels are cameras which display a primary color. Objects that match that primary color come into existence, which will allow the player to solve puzzles that they'd be faced with. However, they may also create objects that block the player's path, maybe causing the player to leave a camera behind to hold a perspective that they wouldn't be able to hold on their own. Obscura plays with perspective, platforming, and color as tools for creating an engaging experience for players.

Protect the camp with tools and traps as a Defender, or try and blend in and infect as many of the civilians as you can as an Imposter. Play with up to 6 players in this tense and exciting social deduction game mixed with horror and strategy. ZOMBIE IMPOSTER: Shut down generators and spread infections in town. Discreetly shapeshift within the cover of the night and kill people. Blend with the population and do tasks around the camp. DEFENDERS: Protect the population. Scan the area or place traps to catch the zombie. Repair the damage made by the zombie. Kill the Imposter before the population drops too low. KEY FEATURES Asymmetrical Social Deduction: Play as either a Zombie Imposter, blending in to kill as many civilians as possible in the camp, or a Defender, attempting to figure out who amongst the civilians is secretly a zombie. Cause Mayhem as the Zombie Imposter: As a Zombie Imposter, pretend you are one of the many civilians of the camp and break as many generators as possible to spread the infection. Once enough infection has spread, an Imposter can transform into a monstrous zombie form, which allows them to attack civilians directly. Protect the camp as a Defender: Defenders can take on the roles of Hunters or Engineers. Hunters take down zombie imposters easily and can lay down traps to expose them. Meanwhile, Engineers have tools that allow them to quickly find broken generators, and reveal the imposter amongst the civilians.

(Isn’t there always?) Though you’re from the Witching Realm, where magic is commonplace, you’ll be enrolling at a summer camp for Humans who have long since forgotten that Witchcraft exists. While summering in the Human Realm, you'll have to conceal your identity and make sure not to get caught practicing your craft. Make friends, cast spells, and uncover secrets during your first ever summer away from home. Welcome to Camp W!

You’ll have to decide which campers interest you the most and then get to know them and their stories over the course of your playthrough. Mysteries Await - There’s more to a summer at Camp W than kickball and friendship bracelets. Discover secrets about the history of the Witching Realm and battle evil forces who threaten to rain on your summer fun. Get Your “Choose” On - You decide which camp activities to attend, which questions to ask, and how you want to respond at critical moments throughout the game. One playthrough won’t be enough to explore every path of this branching story. A Hand-Drawn World - Visit more than twenty beautifully illustrated locations--during the day and at night--and hang out with fifteen fun characters, all of which feature a range of fun poses and expressions. Not to mention your Grimoire, which will fill up with drawings as you play through the game. Collectables Galore - Cast 12 different spells, earn 18 unique badges, and unlock 60+ illustrated memories. You’ll have to replay the game to see them all, but it’s worth it--and you’ll earn achievements along the way. All-Ages...But Not Just For Kids - Camp W was designed to be enjoyed by all ages, and we mean it. Youngsters and adults alike will find a lot to love about the story, dialogue, humor and drama throughout the game.

In the basement’s darkness, where cobwebs cling to to wooden beams like the memory of a lost loved one, dreams and truths entwine. The world lies far, far away — its secrets veiled. What has happened to it? Or perhaps, what would have happened? This dream, a fragile tapestry, unravels against the cosmic loom of life. All is weird The Master’s will, an iron decree, governs the broken kingdom of Gnomes. A dark mission, veiled in shadows, beckons only in the Prologue’s hallowed pages. The ink smells of ancient forests, and the parchment cradles forgotten oaths. See what the Kingdom will become, should you falter. The Gnomes’ destiny rests upon your trembling hands — their hopes, sorrows, their whispered lullabies. And there, amidst the gnarled roots, a voice in your head murmurs cryptic riddles. Is it memory or prophecy? Listen closely. Escape from the nightmare, dear wanderer. Traverse the labyrinth of ink, blood, and imagination.

209390,Dungeonbowl - Knockout Edition,"Jul 2, 2012",0 - 20000,0,0,0.0,0,0,"With Dungeonbowl Knockout Edition discover an exclusive way to play Blood Bowl®, the brutally funny mix between fantasy and American Football, already adapted as a video game by Cyanide. Inspired by a famous tabletop game from Games Workshop, Dungeonbowl offers you a dangerous and crazy sport opposing two football teams, but also a deep tactical turn based game driven by dice. The key difference between Dungeonbowl and Blood Bowl as is rather obvious from the name, is that Dungeonbowl is played in a dungeon! The game also introduces some subtle modifications to the standard Blood Bowl rules. A match is still played between two teams, but each side is composed of three races. For example, the roster of a Rainbow Wizards team contains Wood Elves, Halflings and Humans. Dungeonbowl Knockout Edition features a total of 10 colleges of magic, which allows you to choose between a lot of different compositions! The second difference is that the first team to score a touchdown wins the match. This task is made significantly more difficult by the fact that the ball is hidden in one of six treasure chests, five of which are booby-trapped with an explosive spell. Last, but by no means least, movement within the dungeon is both facilitated and complicated by teleporter pads. These allow players to magically zap from one position to another; a mishap, however, can lead to a player being zapped out of the match. Dungeonbowl Knockout Edition allows you to challenge other players online but also to play single player against each college of Magic managed by the computer AI, with different levels of difficulty! Thanks to the in-game dungeon editor, you can build your own environment to play in. With Dungeonbowl Knockout Edition, you’ll be able to use a large variety of components including all the previous DLCs. Enjoy a myriad of maps and share your own dungeons with the whole community! Prepare some epic games with the new Dungeonbowl Knockout Edition! If you enjoy tactical games, sport and heroic fantasy, try Dungeonbowl now! Key Features: Play Blood Bowl… in a Dungeon! Exploding chests, teleporters, rivers of boiling lava and various other traps all serve to spice-up the matches, making them even more dangerous… NEW! Play against other players in competitives matches or against the computer AI. Build your own pitches in the game's dungeon editor and share it with the community. Use mixed teams made up of several races, from the Warhammer world.

424030,War of Rights,"Dec 3, 2018",200000 - 500000,721,0,29.99,0,0,"War of Rights is a multiplayer game set during the perilous days of the American Civil War, in the Maryland Campaign of September, 1862. Campfire Games is devoted to presenting the gruesome and glorious elements of the period, while maintaining the highest level of historical accuracy and realism as is possible with the wonders of CRYENGINE. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ - Massive battles: Take part in engagements consisting of 300 players. - Tailored for line formation teamplay: Custom formation buff mechanic system rewards sticking together by lessening the suppression effects, the morale cost for the team when dying and the flag bearer respawn rate. - Multiple army branches: Fall in on the line as an infantryman or shatter the fighting spirit of the enemy as an artillery crewman! - Historical accuracy: Period correct uniforms, weapons, manual of arms animations, battlefields, objectives &amp; drill camps. - Regimental pride: 135 researched and recreated regiments &amp; batteries all supporting uniforms for all ranks (Private to Colonel) and player classes. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ - Immersive communication: In-game 3D voice system. - Recreated battlefields: More than 30 historically accurate skirmish areas of the Battles of Antietam and South Mountain as well as the Siege of Harpers Ferry to play on and three drill camps to perfect your formation forming abilities or simply exchange battle stories at the campfire. - Player classes: Private, NCO, Flag Bearer, Drummer, Bugler, Fifer &amp; Officer playable from every regiment &amp; battery featured and covering all ranks from Private to Colonel. - Community focus: A strong company (player organized clans) focus with a dedicated company tool and forum sections devoted to in-game event creation. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ - Powerful game engine: Powered by CRYENGINE V, War of Rights is capable of providing visuals unmatched by any other Civil War game. - More than a game: War of Rights is a vision that keeps expanding its scale. The project is entirely crowdfunded and has been developed on for the past 6 years. We consider it more of an ever evolving artistic piece rather than a final product with a targeted release deadline with set features. Players in the game will be able to play on multiple battlefields of the campaign, from the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers where the Siege of Harper's Ferry took place, to the ridgelines of South Mountain, and to the meandering waters of Antietam Creek at the Battle of Antietam. Additionally, players will also be able to choose from a list of regiments that fought in each battle as well as what rank to fight as, whether they want to slog it out as a lowly private, or if you want to orchestrate the carnage and mayhem as a major general. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Uniforms and bodily features will all be customizable for other players to see as you march and fight in the lines of battle according to the tactics of the period. As a General, you will operate in your headquarters equipped with a map of the battlefield and constantly receiving reports of friendly and enemy positions. Send out new orders to the regiments to move forward, or fall back - all in real time. The orders will move down the chain of command, to the Colonels, Majors, down to the Captains in charge of the individual regiments, all of whom have the option to follow the orders of their trusted commander, or rebel against his wishes and fight as you see fit. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Each map contains a period reconstruction of the buildings, farms, forests, roads, and rocks as they were in 1862 so players can fight through the streets of Harper's Ferry, in the wooded heights of Fox's Gap at South Mountain, or in the cornfields and Bloody Lanes of Antietam. Players can feel the whiz of deadly shot and shell fly by their bodies, or hit their comrades or themselves as they scream in a bloody hail from their wounds. Limbs will fly and blood will be spilt once again as Campfire Games brings the fighting of the Civil War right to the player's computer screen! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Will you heed the Union call against the traitors? Or will you fight to defend your family and livelihood with the Confederacy? You decide! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ We thought it a good idea to recreate/repost our Early Access roadmap as a lot of players having joined us recently are unlikely to know what we are intending to offer as the game advances in its development. The below roadmap should be taken for what it is - a preliminary list of things we have planned for. As all plans are subject to change, there is a great chance that the list will also end up changing, however. The order of the roadmap is also subject to change as the development moves ahead. Some things listed may arrive a great deal sooner or later than what their listing order indicates. 1. Bug fixes, stability improvements: This will be an ongoing focus throughout the development of the game. An alpha is never without its bugs. New content rarely comes without its fair share of bugs and issues required to fix up. 2. Performance improvements: We are well aware of the performance of the alpha is needing to be improved - especially at higher playercounts. Major programming work is currently going into reworking the most expensive part of the game at high playercounts. Once finished you should all be experiencing much better framerates on populated servers. 3. Expanded server moderation tools: This will allow server administrators more control to manage and configure their server using commands such as: kick,ban,change map, change skirmish area, change weather and time of day. 4. Improved melee: Melee is going to be receiving a much needed overhaul, including the availability of a parry move and animation kill sequences between two players (“kill-moves”) to increase the visual fidelity of close quarter fighting. 5. New battlefields: The Battles of South Mountain and Shepherdstown will eventually complete the Maryland Campaign of 1862. 6. Historical Battles mode: Besides the quicker Skirmish mode, the largest and main game mode intended for the game, known as Historical Battles, would open up the entirety of the 4x4 km battlefields for more of a complete playthrough, with a moving frontline consisting of several capture areas. This will also entail the use of the full chain of command where players take the part of Generals, using maps and couriers to direct troops across the huge battlefield. 7. Generals: The chain of command on the battlefield will be expanded with the addition of generals. Generals bring a tactical overview to the battle that all other classes lack, helping to command the troops when using the historical battles mode, helping to bring some order to the chaos of war. 8. Cavalry: Horses are to be implemented for both cavalry units, moving artillery pieces, as well as for the high command and their couriers. The cavalry was still an important branch of the armies of the period considering the changes in technology, acting as reconnaissance and quick response units as understandings for their use developed over the period of the war. 9. Final Release: Once the above features have been finished, we will be at the point that we would be just about ready for full release of the game to all and sundry! This final release would also be the point that those that had backed us originally would be getting their promised physical and digital goods. While we cannot give any definite date as to when we might get to release, we inch closer every day!",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/424030/header.jpg?t=1649485227,https://warofrights.com/,,Support@warofrights.com,True,False,False,0,,0,7254,1163,,10,7256,"War of Rights aims to portray Civil War period fighting.

517660,Drop Out 0,"Sep 16, 2016",0 - 20000,0,0,1.99,0,0,"Drop Out 0 is an online first person shooter with a twist: there are no hitpoints! Beat your opponents by knocking them out of the map. Gameplay Drop Out is played in matches of up to 8 players, the goal is to get as many points as possible in a team, or alone, within the time limit. You gain 2 points for every enemy player you knock out of the map and you lose 1 point every time you are knocked out of the park. Every suicide will result in a withdrawal of 2 points to your own score, you clumsy oaf! The game offers a variety of weapons that allow for different strategies and playstyles; whether you want to rocketjump, snipe or fistfight there will be something for you! Mechanics The game is built for multiplayer, you can play online, cross-platform easily and quickly. There is also an offline mode where you can practice against bots. LAN mode is clunkily available for windows, but can be improved and expanded if there is demand for it. Playing online will grant you XP which you can spend to get new weapons, perks and skills. To keep the game balanced, you can unlock anything at any time. The price per unlock ramps up, making sure you can get a full set very quickly but getting every set will take some time. The percentage at the bottom of your screen is your susceptibility. This number increases as you take damage, the higher your susceptibility the more knockback you will experience when taking hits. Features At the time of writing there are 5 maps, 13 weapons, 8 perks, 2 character models and 2 skins for each. I will still be working on adding more content after release, which will be gradually added to the game. Any player can host their own game on provided servers. As host you can kick/ban players and manage the timer and level selection. When joining a game, the player can choose one of his created character load-outs. These can be switched in between deaths. The game has been playtested a reasonable amount, but there might still be balance issues and bugs. I will try to keep up with the Steam community to notice and fix such problems as soon as possible. System requirements Versions are available for Windows, Mac and Linux. The game is not too heavy performance wise, but just in case it has a bare bone setting so you can still run it on your favourite toaster. You will of course need internet connection with a reasonable speed to play online in real time! About me As you might have guessed there is no professional team behind Drop Out. I am a 21 year old physicist in training from Belgium, when I’m not discovering the laws of the universe I like to work on my game development. In the past few years I have worked on several smaller projects but nothing on the scale of Drop Out. During this time, i learned how to work with Unity and Blender which culminated in Drop Out 0. No matter what career I might choose in the future, I am very passionate about making games, so you might see a new title pop up on Steam in a few years. Expect something wildly different though! Special thanks to: Doug Bryant (BulletMagnet) for the weapon models and teaching me how to model better, Marnick39 for helping with coding, ideas and balancing, Unity for their buggy game engine, PhotonEngine for their equally buggy networking code. Thanks to the testing team, including CubicWarrior, Deraldo, Tafikay, Woxic, Patat, Joey, Anivia, hallway A1 and the FunnyJunk community! Music by Louis Davita (check out his soundcloud).

1704490,Inferno,"Apr 29, 2022",0 - 20000,0,0,6.99,0,0,"Inferno is a simple but atmospheric puzzle game where you follow the journey of Dante Alighieri through the Nine Circles of Hell. The game is an adaptation of his epic poem Inferno written over 700 years ago, and between levels it includes many memorable quotes from the poem together with colorized artwork. Features Over 100 unique puzzles Nine levels of hell, each with its own athmosphere, lighting, music, and puzzle themes Follow Dante's original poem between levels and use the built in dictionary to look up words and the characters Dante meets. If you've never read Inferno , this game gives you an introduction Fifty classical paintings and engravings by Gustave Doré and others, colorized for this game Achievements on steam Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark, For the straightforward pathway had been lost Can You Make It Through All Nine Circles? Circles of Hell The forest Just like the poem, the game starts with Dante being lost in a dark forest. In this tutorial section you learn the controls and the physics of the game world. Gameplay here is centered around Sokoban-style box-pushing mechanics and ladders. The forest is brighter than most of the game, and the music is relaxing but somber. Dante meets Virgil who promises to guide him, and together they pass through the gates of Hell. Vestibule of Hell Before Dante and Virgil can enter Hell proper they pass through the Vestibule. Here you learn more about how gravity works, and how you can carry boxes on top of your head. The vestibule lies underground, but there are still trees, dirt, and some light from outside. Dante and Virgil meet Charon who takes them across the first river of Hell and to the first circle. The first Circle - Limbo According to Dante, Limbo is inhabited by the souls who in life picked neither the side of good nor evil, as well as the unbaptized and people who lived before christianity. This first circle of hell also has trees and fresh green meadows - here Dante and Virgil talks to old Greek and Roman philosophers. The music is mysterious and slow, and the lights area greenish. Gameplay is about manipulating blocks that have ladders attached. The Circle of Lust This circle contains the souls of the lustful who 'reason subjugated to appetite'. Here Dante and Virgil meet Cleopatra, Tristan, Helen of Troy, and they listen to Francescas tragic love story. These souls of this circle are forever thrown around in an infernal hurricane. The circle has a blueish purple theme, with rainstorms and violent winds. The gameplay in the circle of lust is about locks and keys. The Circle of Gluttony The circle of Gluttony goes in brown and yellow, it is full of dirt, mud, rain and hail, with the music having a medieval vibe. The gluttons lie in the mud turning themselves around, their punishment for a life of excess. In this section Dante can first interact with the inhabitants of hell - pushing a glutton makes him continue moving in the same direction until he hits a wall. The Circle of Greed Here lives the avaricious and the spendthrifts - like Sisyphous they push huge bags of money around. This circle introduces 'walkers' - souls that move in according to a simple patrolling movement pattern that the player can manipulate. The Circle goes in colors of green and gold and the music is relaxing but eerie. The Circle of Wrath In this section Dante and Virgil have to cross the swampy river Styx. Below the surface lies the wrathful, forever gurgling their throats. This section is very dark, and the music is creepy and oppressive. The gameplay is centered around manipulating lightsources - Dante has to carry them around, and combine lights of different colorsto break light-sensitive blocks. The Circle of Heresy Dante and Virgil pass through the City walls of Dis - the city of Hell - and enter the circle of Heresy. Heretics are those that rejected Christianity, here reside Greeks like Epicurus, and Anastasius II the heretical Pope. The heretics are standing in flaming tombs, forever being burned for their sin. The circle of Heresy has black walls, ramparts, and towers. The music is dark and mysterious, but gentle compared to the last circle. The circle of heresy has many classical puzzles implemented in the game engine - a sliding square puzzle, the towers of Hanoi, a tetris-puzzle and much more. The Circle of Violence According to Dante there are three types of violence: against your neighbour, agains yourself, and against God. This circle is divided accordingly. The first round contains Pflegethon, the river of boiling blood. Beyond lies a dark forest where people are turned into trees, and the last round is a desert with raining fire. The mechanic in this Circle is cooperative play - Virgil will help Dante and you can switch between the characters to solve puzzles together. The Circle of Fraud Dante and Virgil enter 'Malebolge', the evil ditches of the Circle of Fraud. Here different types of fraudsters are punished in creative ways, each according to his crime. This circle is fiery red with a very intense soundtrack. The mechanic is based around a type of sand-block that breaks on touch. The Well of Giants Between the circles of fraud and treachery lies the Well of Giants. Here three Giants are forever chained for their rebellion against God. In this short section Dante and Virgil has to climb and manipulate the Giants to solve puzzles. The well is stone-colored with turquoise lighting and water running down the walls. The Circle of Treachery This deepest circle of hell is covered in ice, with cold winds blowing from inside. Here traitors are frozen solid inside the ice, their tears forever freezing on their faces. The music has a slower and mysterious vibe. This circle combines all the mechanics from the previous circles - many puzzles are based on breakable ice-blocks together with walkers, allowing you to carve out paths for the walkers and construct a type of mechanical circuits. The circle of treachery ends with a showdown in the centre of Hell and an epilogue.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1704490/header.jpg?t=1651246420,https://blue-vertex.github.io/inferno,,infernopuzzle@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,2,0,,12,0,"The gameplay contains no mature content at all.

Play as the unconquerable Britons and their motley-crew of soldiers! A force remarkable for its diversity, including Englishmen, Scotsmen, Welshmen, Irishmen – representing everyone from the working classes to the upper class elite of the United Kingdom. Under the leadership of the fiery Sir Winston Churchill, this assorted mix put aside their differences and became the only remaining Western European nation to escape the grip of Axis-dominated Europe, before leading the final offensive with the other Allied Forces. The British Army features a brand new set of distinctive tactical gameplay options articulated around a new tech tree including new infantry, team weapons, vehicles, upgrades, commanders with unique abilities and a total of eight new multiplayer maps portraying historic battlefield locations. Battles reach an unprecedented level of authenticity with the addition of motion-captured data for the most common animation sets, which will also enhance all the previously released Company of Heroes 2 armies. By introducing a new faction with a unique playstyle, The British Forces further reinforces Company of Heroes 2 as the most comprehensive World War II platform for RTS fans.

Meanwhile, the new commanders’ abilities revolve around impressive staged events making the most of air raids and artillery. ARMY WITH CHARACTER An international cast of actors from England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and New-Zealand bring the units to life, with accents ranging from the posh elite to the working class. The writing of the units’ audio cues was also given special attention in order to ensure the various regional differences – and rivalries – among the British subjects stand out. IMPROVED MO-CAPPED ANIMATIONS The battlefield comes to life like never before thanks to motion-captured data for the most common animation set (SMG), that will also update all of the previous armies’ animation systems. NEW MAPS Eight stunning new maps enhance the extensive collection of pre-existing Company of Heroes 2 maps as well as thousands of community created maps available on the Steam workshop.

Get to the truth. Find out what happened to the people on the surface. Pick Your Apocalypse From a nuclear war to global pandemic or meteorite strike, choose your apocalyptic scenario in an expansive sandbox. Learn to Survive In the campaign mode, you will learn how to survive. Select from a number of missions to learn how to effectively run a bunker! Build Your Shelter Construct underground shelters equipped with all the modern amenities to survive the apocalypse. You’ll need a variety of items to survive the harsh world outside. Have your settlers loot and pillage other bunkers to bring home all kinds of essential supplies. Upgrade Your Facilities Use precious resources to upgrade the bunker’s rooms to increase the amount of civilians who can live inside. Unlock and expand the bunker with 10 special rooms, each with a key function. The Foodblock, for instance, allows settlers to provide food to the entire settlement whereas the laboratory allows settlers to conduct scientific experiments. Setting up all 14 slots for rooms in your bunker is vital to ensuring your survivors are as safe and efficient as possible. Manage Your Civilians Monitor morale and productivity, food rationing, electricity, and how many hours of sleep survivors get to increase your shelter’s efficiency and resources. You can control your bunker's wider purpose by switching its focus from ‘working’ to ‘science’. Build Your Army Form an army that will protect your surface resources from being pillaged by roaming looters. Select from an array of weapons and soldier types, before sending your troops out into hostile territory to attack other bunkers and claim their resources for your own.","['English', 'Russian', 'French', 'German', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Polish', 'Turkish']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1256830/header.jpg?t=1638554513,,http://hamstersgaming.com/,info@hamstersgaming.com,True,False,False,0,,0,191,84,,0,252,,0,0,0,0,Hamsters Gaming,Hamsters Gaming,Single-player,"Indie,Simulation,Strategy","Simulation,Colony Sim,Economy,Turn-Based Tactics,Post-apocalyptic,Management,Survival,City Builder,Sandbox,Dungeon Crawler,Building,Turn-Based Strategy,Strategy RPG,Strategy,Military,3D,Funny,Story Rich,War,Sci-fi","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1256830/ss_fdf5d3a98b36312e820952203d89b150bee962be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638554513,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1256830/ss_f01ae01b73f93a409f839c59a4bb980442c623be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638554513,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1256830/ss_74ffb86b7a9d93fddf9d15193bf552ab953c64d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638554513,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1256830/ss_afe5d46d97627c07dc72034e0efbf83a56d6ea6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638554513,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1256830/ss_fa205fa4aed5a2948254b82344a35ba4573200b5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638554513,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1256830/ss_6ac1d16bb723976020bedac2060002b64b1425ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638554513,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1256830/ss_248ae7cb14a72bfa0b0659b7019274d73288f294.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638554513,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1256830/ss_d882348833ed63cb3cb9bdbd4db50d40381e106e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1638554513","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256854456/movie_max.mp4?t=1633360050,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256850423/movie_max.mp4?t=1633063341"

1707610,Imperium BCE,"Jun 9, 2022",0 - 20000,1,0,24.99,0,0,"Be a leader of one of the greatest civilizations in the world. Bring glory to Rome, in our upcoming title, Imperium BCE. Would you expand Rome's borders through war? Or would you destabilize and divide kingdoms using spies? In Imperium BCE, you can use many different strategies, to bring about the inevitable Roman dominion. Surrounded by different kingdoms and cultures, you will need to maintain balance and spread your influence slowly, so as not to alarm your neighbors. Your spies will have to work in secret, act on your orders, to strengthen your culture and religion, making your enemies weaker. Your diplomats might work on improving relations with other kingdoms or might provide you with valid justification for war. Events Being in control of a sprawling empire comes at a cost. Unexpected things happen. Events take place which are outside of the control of even the most powerful people. In Imperium BCE, there are events that can hold you back or propel you forward. An unforeseen rain might ruin the crops. This can lead to food shortages, citizen dissatisfaction, anger with the Gods for letting it happen, or maybe anger with you, for not doing enough for your people. Will you find a way to appease them? Will you follow the advice of your priests, and have rituals conducted, to celebrate your Gods, at a great cost of the coin, in order to make your citizens happy? Your choices could have dire consequences. Thread carefully. Spies Weaken your enemies. Soften the battlefield. Some of your greatest assets in Imperium BCE will be your spies. Well trained to operate in secret, your spies will sabotage, assassinate, and do whatever it takes to make Roman take-over easier. Give your spies time and resources, and they will steal essential supplies, spread your culture far and wide, and even disperse diseases, which can devastate entire populations. Just hope that they never get caught... War Train some of the mighties warriors that ever walked the Earth. Bring your enemies to their knees with advanced battle strategies, reward your soldiers with land, besiege cities, and expand your territory. Attack when your enemies are vulnerable, be able to defend your citizens against anyone who dares to make a move against you. Fight sea battles and maintain control of the sea. When the dust settles, Rome should have prevailed! Diplomacy Win hearts and minds, improve relations, give gifts. Hide your true intentions. Your diplomats will repair the damage in reputation, caused by your conquests. A good diplomat will make an agitated king feel at ease as if the Roman invasion is not just around the corner. When the time is right, they will provoke and insult, leading kings and their people, into your well-prepared trap. Wars can be prevented or set in motion by a crafty diplomat. Use them well. Building Provide your architects with the resources needed to build the unimaginable! Develop your cities, turn villages into towns, have your citizens witness Rome growing beyond their wildest imagining. Build structures that will stand the test of time. Different buildings will provide you with different benefits but will take time to construct. Plan your expansion carefully. Your enemies will be envious of your achievements! Discoveries Encourage bright minds to work on inventions, for the benefit of all. Either by stealing knowledge from other Civilizations, or by careful study, your researchers will help you strengthen Rome, and crush other Civilizations. As some discoveries can take years to be put into use, you will have to choose carefully which discovery to pour limited resources into. Have patience. Good things take time.

Features; For now, OOTR has 2 Factions ,3 Maps, 15+ Characters ,12+ Buildings and 3 Game mode. (It will be upgraded very soon!) Our 2 factions are EAGLE and RedCross. They are historical fiction style factions. That means our all factions will be have a historical base. With our factions there will be faction based buildings and characters that you can control. Every character and building will be unique with their faction. Map are unique and good planed for optimum equality. No one has an advantage over anyone else. Some maps are more challenging than others cause of the geography. Every map has tricks to master and learn. OOTR right now has 1 game mod and that’s multiplayer. Multiplayer is what we are focused on while making the game. It will be fun, equal and challenging. Hard but for a good player it will be rewarding. Upcoming mods are Skirmish, Survival and Campaign. There is no match to OOTR’s graphics in RTS genre. Nothing luck based, Nothing Random, Nothing unreasonable .. Everything is in your hands and skills. Fog of war system. Balanced navigating minimap. Micro and macro gameplay balance. 360 free camera for cinematic footage. UPCOMING UNIQUE stealth FEATURES (LAND SYSTEM and ORDERS SYSTEM) Gameplay; Multiplayer gameplay what are we looking for. Balanced, unique also feels old school. (You will see new things and at the same time you will taste the old RTS experience.) Build and Upgrade buildings. Summon peasants, knights, archers, horses etc. to serve you. Improve your lands, Improve your army, Improve your folk and be stronger. Defend your lands while conquer others. Gather resources for improve. And be the only Ruler in your lands with defeating other players. Orders of the Ruler is a indie RTS game which has you commanding your folk in a medieval world. You are the RULER and your mission is protect your lands while invading others. Face other Ruler's for the sake of wealth and honor. Command your army, build your base, gather resources and improve with your loyal soldiers. Some Of the Characters, Buildings and Factions; Workers;They are Peasants that cutting trees, plowing fields, mining ores, making buildings and do whatever they RULER orders to them. They are hard workers that have honor. Their loyalty to their RULER is undeniable and they can fight to protect their lands if the situation requires. They can build anything, like houses, barracks, farms, towers, walls. Spearman; Long pointy tools. Invented for fruit gathering and hunting but it seems it’s a strong item for killing man too. Spears and pikes are the most successful weapons in war. They have the most range of all melee weapons. They are the backbone of the war. Knight; Have the best and most expensive armor, have a big sword and they are noble. They are superior on the battlefield. Simple soldier can't do anything against heavy armored knight. Militia; They are peasants that trained fighting to protect their village. They are not too powerful. They just want to live in freedom but sometimes without war freedom is no possible. Base; This is your main hub my Lord. Protect it even if your life on the line. A good ruler never escapes (if it’s not a strategy ofc). RULE them from here. Command your ORDERS from here. Live here and die here. You’re here to defend your lands and invade others. Land is power and you should not allow any exceptions. Farm; Food. You need to eat and maintain your strength my Lord. These buildings earn your food to feed yourself and your people. Never underestimate food. If there is no food there is no soldiers there is no peasants, there is not even a RULER. Keep your food safe. Remember one old saying my Lord. EAGLE; Land means power and wealth. This religious order sees their lands as their honor. Gain more and lose none. They carry the holy EAGLE emblem to battlefield. EAGLE brings fear to their foes heart and brings serenity to their follower’s minds. Redcross; Religious order that praises to bible. They are honorable and fearless. They are believing death is not the end and if you combat for your RULER you get rewarded gold, honor and every wealth after you die with an honorable death. Their emblem is the holy RED CROSS.

After some yet unknown global events, Earth has become hostile and packed with not-so-dead 'people' - and you're amongst the survivors who try to escape to a better place. Is there a better place? Fast-paced, non-stop zombie carnage. One of our goals is that you won't ever have a second to yawn. Enemies are always lurking around and bring different challenges. RPG Elements. Crafting, scrapping, repairing, perks, and a little dose of RNG - yep, all included! Every match is unique. New experiences at each new game. Designed with deck-building gameplay in mind, you'll be able to experiment with different roles, perks, and weapons - all that resulting in surprisingly fun and distinct playstyles.

For the competitive players, leaderboards exist - can you make it to the top and stay there? Includes 40 in-game quests, with corresponding Steam achievements! The puzzle battle gameplay works as follows: each of the 25 tiles on the field is a certain color. When you correctly reveal a tile, a number will be displayed inside that tile. This number tells you how many of the 4 surrounding tiles (North, South, East, and West - NO DIAGONALS!) are that same color. When you incorrectly guess a tile, you will be hit by the monster you're currently battling. Different monsters have different properties, effects, and so on. Throughout the dungeon you will find equipment which will aid you in battle, for example by allowing you to regenerate hit points or have armor to reduce the damage you take from enemies. Conveniently, the game auto-saves after each battle. You can exit out of the application and resume later.

Play at your own peril. A big reason for that is that it's been created using this ancient game engine called 3D Rad, which has a ton of limitations and quirks. Of course someone who knows what he's doing could make a decent game out of it, but this was one of the first games i've ever made and i had zero skills and self awareness. If you really have to play a game of mine, pick something more recent, such as 30 Days to be the Best or Mariuccha, Alchemy Queen. They also suck but they don't crash if you press Escape. Links: / / Anyway, the original description of the game: The time has finally come!

Lightrise gives players a combat experience not quite like anything else available out there. Lightrise has much more depth than a traditional one-shot, one-kill FPS, but at the same time does not have any of the familiar restraints such as classes, roles and load outs that are typically found in games of the genre today. Right from the start, each player has access to an identical arsenal of spells and skills - the playing field is as even as it could be - no strongest classes, no flavor of the month builds, no over-powered load out configurations. Every player can shoot a bow, cast a fireball or swing an axe seamlessly without any artificial restrictions. Every win and loss will be determined solely by how well you play in that

959520,Fantasy Blacksmith,"Nov 15, 2019",100000 - 200000,9,0,2.49,0,3,"You are a blacksmith in the world of the sword, magic and war, in which any blacksmith who knows how to make even the simplest swords is in demand. You start off as a poor unskilled blacksmith, but in time you will gain experience and improve to achieve wealth, fame and power, and change this world! Fantasy Blacksmith is a magically realistic blacksmith simulator in which you have to create and sell weapons. Also, your smith will gain more experience and become stronger and more accurate with each created sword. You can also improve your equipment in the smithy, buy a better forge, better grindstone, improve your hammer and etc. We want to create an exciting and interesting simulator in which any player can make his dream sword. 'You are a smith and you create swords!' The creation of the sword begins with the drawing. The sword consists of 8 parts: Blade (5 parts), Cross-guard, Handle, Top. You choose the material from which the sword will be made. It can be iron, bronze, titan, tungsten, mithril, silver, gold, etc. Using the large number of options offered and your imagination, you can create a huge number of unique swords. We believe that there may be more than 10 billion different swords that you can create. 'Using a hammer, beat your ingot into a blade' According to your drawing, you will be hammering the red-hot metal to give it the shape of a blade. You also need to remember to keep the metal temperature high, if it cools down, you can not forge it. 'Finally I can make Damascus steel' You will have the opportunity to practice alchemy. Using different chemical mixtures of the correct recipe, you can create a damask pattern on your sword. Depending on the proportion of the mix of the chemical elements, and on the heating and holding the mixture, the result will depend. One thing I can say for sure, you will not get two identical patterns. 'Feel yourself a witch' One of the most interesting parts of the gameplay is making a magic potion. This is a very exciting and dangerous process. Having done everything correctly you will get a new sword from the mythical material, but if you make a mistake you can spoil the sword or even destroy it. In the game there will be a lot of ingredients for the magical boiler and by collecting everything by recipe, you will get many different potions. 'Long live runic magic' To superimpose magic effects on weapons, runes will be used, depending on the pattern on the magic table, different spells will be cast on the weapon.

336210,Just Death,"Feb 24, 2016",0 - 20000,0,0,14.99,0,0,"Just Death is an “Open-World Sandbox Crime Game” set in procedurally generated cities. At its core gameplay mode - Just Death is my take on the Vigilante genre. You must rid the streets of “thugs and scum” using your antihero, playing in the first or third person. Due to the procedural nature of the environments, I can provide ample replayability with ease. The game has an Online open-city multiplayer mode, and 3 offline gameplay modes (Vigilante, Bank Heist, and Gang War). Gameplay modes Vigilante ( clean up the streets from scum and bad guys ). Bank Heist ( rob the bank with friends, and escape the procedural cities ). Gang War ( fight for control of the city against other gangs ). You can also play online in a multiplayer open-city mode. Procedural City Generation The core feature of Just Death is the Procedurally Generated Cities . With a feature like this, I can provide the players with almost unlimited gameplay environments, by simply changing the “seed number” used to randomly generate the world, or by changing the simplistic input splines which form the “backbone” or basis for the city generation. See the image below for a visualization of the input and output my technology can produce. One issue that has plagued procedurally generated environments for the longest time is that they always look “boring”. My solution was to simulate every layer of a city individually with as much detail as possible, to hopefully alleviate the repetition. The static environment details I procedurally generate include: buildings, skyscrapers, roads, sidewalks, intersections, crosswalks, elevated train tracks, alleyways, plazas, parks, fences, traffic lights, street lights, trees, fire hydrants, phone booths, newspaper dispensers, trash bins, dumpsters, garbage bags, paper debris, sewers, vents, utility access panels, and more! Below are a set of real-time images from the Procedurally Generated Cities in Just Death . Core Features @ Final Release - Procedurally Generated Cities - Online Mulitplayer Open-City mode (64 players-per-server, currently supports 16 in test servers), and 3 Offline Gameplay modes (Vigilante, Bank Heist, and Gang War). - 50+ Weapons (when game is finished) - 25+ Vehicles (when game is finished) - XP/Rank/Statistics tracking through Steam",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/header.jpg?t=1456370917,http://www.JustDeath.com,http://www.RadioactiveSoftware.com,dgreen@radioactive-software.com,True,False,False,0,,0,14,18,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Radioactive-Software,Radioactive-Software,"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Stats,Steam Leaderboards,Includes level editor","Action,Indie,Early Access","Action,Indie,Early Access","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_d06911166a3bfa22568be32c96151fb318ea7be1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_0114e584592aa253b8f437c3070256703fd03ddb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_233e9470c48f1a59081557ddc4e7d47256edc34e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_1097c921f67ca955e784e3ebb00bb1777f509136.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_c8dcaa20603c8deb3768d33362e10150c18d4802.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_dadfdacc4e6c398d4e129c4eb4ba1c1345924a4a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_4c8a2ab0abfad9c2f9cb990ea8b6ae2b76419447.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_758d27c43abf3cb0642e96a48f41ce50b4da69f9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_2b5db07f4920e5ffd3e0ca2f46ddc67025bac1de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_1ddd1c4c219bf02873d066fbcc975ddaeff2668e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_935bf5d1e8a9a775de8aa9414069847fbe98f0c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_4ff19998b830c6bcf862d9b389b5a66383aab5f1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_a42ecb092db14ff446d598f33e2575efd57373bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/336210/ss_ae2f637d373c22ee1e82b6965894349f6a3c1984.1920x1080.jpg?t=1456370917",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256660692/movie_max.mp4?t=1455575143

2276420,Songs Of Death,"Jul 30, 2024",20000 - 50000,85,0,6.29,0,0,"This is a roguelike rhythm action game that requires you to block and counter (accurate block) enemy attacks at the right moment. This is a fictional world based on characters from the Three Kingdoms. Here, there are not only martial skills, but also spiritual energy and technologies that led to the invention of spells and firearms. You will play as Ma Chao, master of a variety of attacks and tools, and break enemy defenses with the help of friends to exact revenge on Cao Cao for slaughtering your family. EXP will be gained from kills for you to level up, unlocking new weapons. Each of the weapons has a unique attack pattern and works best against specific targets. They also have Synergy tags, and activating the same tags grants characters special effects. When you have extra copies of the same weapon, the weapon will be starred up activating its Synergy effects without having to equip the weapon. It is up to you to manage resources for greater combat prowess. It was back when PlayStation 3 was still the latest console, I got obsessed with Drakengard 3. It was the last boss battle, and the rhythm game played to The Final Song by Eir Aoi scarred me permanently and I remembered it to this day. So it began my journey to make a good yet depressing game like Yoko Taro did. Based on this idea, I took elements of Vampire Survivors and Taiko no Tatsujin and added some roguelike and auto battler features to complete this game. As a small segment of the Songs series, the story is relatively independent of the other games, so don't worry if you haven't played the other works in the series. If you are interested in the story, you will need to use different characters to clear the required difficulty levels and stages to unlock each character's story chapters and get a glimpse into the whole story.

795910,Montero,"May 15, 2018",0 - 20000,0,0,3.99,0,0,"General description: Montero is a fantasy mystery with RPG elements. Every game session is a story of a random monster hunter, a dwarf belonging to a special class of fighters trained to deal with rare and dangerous enemies. Going on a quest (that usually takes you from half to one and a half hours), the player will have to protect dwarf settlers living in a randomly generated village from an unknown enemy. History: The principal feature of a developing kingdom is its growing territory. The new lands are wild, and many dangers await brave colonists who dare to settle there. The new settlements need to be protected, but it would be too costly to send troops to the borders every time a problem arises. This is why the kingdom needs Monteros, monster hunters who do not possess superpowers or artifacts, but rely on constant training, intellect, and knowledge of their enemies. Gameplay: Every Montero starts the game already as a skilled tracker, craftsman, fighter, and hunter. The character does not level up any skills during a game session. The success of the mission depends on the player’s choice of the gear and their knowledge of the world that will grow from game to game. To defeat the final boss of the location, you will first have to find out who it is. In order to do that, your character will collect evidence (bits of fur and armor), talk to the locals, and even exhume bodies to examine the wounds. You will have to build barricades, set traps, make gear to prepare for the fight. This requires resources which you will find in the area or among the locals’ possessions. You will also have to help the settlers to recover from wounds, poisons, and illnesses. If there are no settlers left in the village, your mission is considered a failure. The final boss is not your only enemy. The newly settled territory is full of wild animals, robbers, poisonous mushrooms and insects. Monteros feel cold and hunger, suffer from poisoning, bleeding wounds, injuries and stress. The game will create a unique location for each session, so that every new mission is different from the previous ones. A successful mission adds objects to your collection of gear that will always be available for future missions. Succeeding, however, will not be easy, since you will have to adapt to the conditions, manage your resources wisely, learn to navigate the terrain, and be quick to employ your combat skills in a fight. All in all, Montero is mostly about the advancement of the player , not the character.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/795910/header.jpg?t=1573839216,,,Zlorg968@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,9,4,,26,0,,0,0,0,0,Reb_Orn,Reb_Orn,"Single-player,Steam Achievements","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Adventure,RPG,Indie,Survival,Horror,Crafting,Dark,Dark Fantasy,Detective,Fantasy,Atmospheric","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/795910/ss_f379d9081dc1fcee8647de36c1ff73142aa873a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573839216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/795910/ss_d373c4c5091335d004e1868e4f31fb955f4870dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573839216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/795910/ss_d7162ad86e3384bdb543a9b51cd80e94f9e32c1d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573839216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/795910/ss_74b65e3b972b09498c73b4609a19a1d08e616a0c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573839216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/795910/ss_dc15ed7dc42e835d52af12833607bfbccc411633.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573839216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/795910/ss_494376aa9f6d6698e0d150682f53145bd31c9e20.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573839216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/795910/ss_a407d3cdd8891e2ec453179c1d86f0bd3f3ef2a4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573839216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/795910/ss_b038a1cf2edc47fe0528f57aa36dbe064023480b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573839216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/795910/ss_7aca6ec5a1f11d3c09ab7ed5b499d5ae93421dd7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1573839216",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256715554/movie_max.mp4?t=1525204844

Specializing in either rooibos, green, oolong, black or white tea, you will buy and collect ingredients to fulfill your customers’ orders. Each turn you can choose to either visit the tea market, the pantry or to reserve a customer and use an ability. Visiting the tea market There are 6 different tea flavor tiles. Mint, Jasmine, Lemon, Ginger, Berries and Lavender. When you choose this action you will gain a gold coin with the value of three. Spent at least one coin on the market to purchase tea flavor tiles. But you can only have 12 of them stored in your tea house! If the flavor tile is touching tiles of the same type these tiles are also taken (only vertically or horizontally). Think strategically! After each purchase the remaining flavor tiles will slide to the left. After the turn the market will get refilled. Visiting the pantry The pantry offers you Milk, Honey, Vanilla, Chai Spices and Sugar to refine your tea orders. If you choose this action you can pick up to three items that are currently available, or/and blindly draw a random tile from the pantry bag. If your tea house has more than six pantry items you will have to discard them down to this number. After the turn the pantry will be replenished. Reserving a customer and using an ability card Do you have a customer order from the visible customer pool in mind that you would like to take on and don’t lack many ingredients to fulfill it? Maybe choosing to reserve this customer would be a good choice! You can also reserve a customer blindly from the deck. Either way, up to three customer orders can be reserved for your tea house. After reserving a customer you may choose to use one of the ability actions. For example, to take one pantry item from the pantry for free. At the end of one of these actions you may fulfill one customer order from the customer pool or from the orders you reserved. Check what ingredients they want and use your tea house stock to fulfill it! If your tea house specialization doesn’t match the customer orders color (e.g Rooibos = Red but you are specialized in Oolong = Blue) you maybe need to buy a tea token from one of your opponents with this color to fulfill it.

Our little studio's debut project that explores the far reaching impacts that love, friendship, and understanding have on not only our lives, but how we view ourselves and others around us. All wrapped up in a typical anime inspired narrative that we hope everyone who takes the time to play it will enjoy. Story Introducing Ayumi Suzume, a misunderstood high school girl that has been thrown to the side and alienated by her peers for most of her life. Confused, and never understanding why that is, she eventually took her outcast image to heart. Alongside her, her trusty friend Keiko who has been with her since they were little kids. They've always had each other when things got tough. Always taking care of the other when they're not able to do so themselves. Enter the present day... Due to some strange circumstances, Ayumi finds herself in trouble once more. Only this time, she can't rely on her best friend to get her out of it. Instead, she has to rely on the kindness of someone who is a complete stranger to her. Someone with a very special skill that sadly, her best friend since childhood lacks... Together, the two of them must solve the mystery that put Suzume in the position she now finds herself. With her very fate hanging in the balance, will she finally learn to trust those around her? Or, will her initial thoughts prevail? A strange mystery awaits you in the sleepy seaside town of Seishin-Tekina! Features Some backgrounds can be interacted with via a point and click 'Investigation System' that allows players to interact with certain objects during certain points of the story.

The goal is to climb the trees of an ancient and mystical forest in order to break through the canopy. You must manipulate two main characters at the same time throughout the game, solve puzzles, and avoid the hazards of this dark forest. Mankind has been driven from their homes among the trees by the Night King, a nightmarish beast whose origin has been lost to time. Now, man lives in the dirt, fearing the moments the Night King leaves his roost to prey upon their vulnerable forms. Every generation the elders send a young couple out into the world to find a new home for their people where they need not fear the relentless hunger of the Night King. Every generation these journeys have failed. This time however, the young couple has decided to ascend into the trees and reclaim their ancestral home instead of fleeing into the darkness. Can they rise above? Controlling 2 Characters with 1 GamePad In Above: The Fallen, you play as both the male and female characters at the same time (Single Player Mode Only). They often find themselves in situations that require them to work together to solve puzzles and progress up to the canopy. Each character is controlled with one half of the Gamepad. This offers an additional challenge and requires you to think about each character's positioning before moving. If you don't get the hang of it right away, don't worry, it won't be long before you're climbing through the jungle like Tarzan. Single Player or Co-op mode! Bring a friend along with you as you adventure through the world, solve puzzles and work together to defeat the Night King. Swap back and forth easily from single player to co-op with a push of a button. Vertical Scrolling / Climbing Climbing is essential to the goal of reaching the forest's canopy. This differs from traditional side-scrollers where you generally move in a straight line throughout the world. Puzzles There are many interesting puzzles that you'll come across as you play. Some puzzles are solvable in multiple ways which allows for some freedom to explore. Each successfully completed puzzle brings you closer to facing the Night King! Skills As you progress through the world you'll come across shrines that when activated, interact with your amulet, and unlock ancient magic hidden away from humanity. The character's will then receive a new skill which will be needed to complete upcoming puzzles. Enemies There are many animals to watch out for while exploring the forest. Use caution while approaching them though, they don't like being disturbed.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/715490/header.jpg?t=1577205738,http://www.light-loop-games.com,,contactteamabove@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,13,11,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Team Above,Light Loop Games,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together","Adventure,Indie","Adventure,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/715490/ss_8b84ca134eb7b1b9fd14d9e15add68be4261e67b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577205738,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/715490/ss_387b56ee33645cbe753a7d8dddac9924a2ac6718.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577205738,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/715490/ss_867dbaed8560ff3ae7816ceeee5cd69f65ea13c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577205738,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/715490/ss_67bed02d6ea3a6ffc760b38ab76fb88bd207f92e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577205738,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/715490/ss_d7363e5330fa0a3d3ea1898a33f1a541dcfe52bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577205738,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/715490/ss_43686afa783436319b3357600138936a11234f27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577205738,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/715490/ss_6a9d167e526efbe996aeed9a2656dbb94c938545.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577205738",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256695485/movie_max.mp4?t=1505759292

Main Features UNCHANGED - The fun of Hack &amp; Slash comes from annihilating countless enemies at once. As a genre where character growth is tied to devastating enemies to obtain new items, the focus was set upon the proposition to 'gain strength after wiping out enemies' during development. Stirring away from the typical growth system, players will be able to enjoy completing their own unique builds. UNDEFINED - Freedom to Select Various Combat Styles There are no defined classes in UNDECEMBER. Once a character is created after customization, players will be able to freely change around gears and skills based on personal playstyle. Builds are divided into Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence types, but there are no gear or combination restrictions. Players are free to cast magic with a sword or summon minions with a bow, or create any new unique builds of their own. UNLIMITED - Infinite Combination of Skills Runes are classified by Skill and Link Runes. Link Runes assist the effects of Skill Runes.

Watch it play out in real time. Pick your squad’s entry points and gear them up with the arsenal at your disposal. Choose from a list of firearms, armor and grenades - each with their pros and cons - to make sure your team has the right gear for the situation. But be wary: The arsenal doesn’t replenish between missions, so you must always think two steps ahead. Study the 3D map carefully and use the innovative timeline system to move and synchronize your team. Coordinate your movements, grenades and room entries to take the enemy by surprise. One wrong move, one corner left unchecked, could be fatal to your mission - there’s no plan B! Once you’re confident your plan is perfect, the time has come to execute your actions and press that play button. Watch your orders unfold, and get right into the middle of the action with the full-control camera. Planned a perfect mission? Share your replays and show off those tactical skills! Challenge yourself with multi-path campaigns: Select carefully on the rogue-like map which missions you’ll take and which rewards you’ll need, as there’ll be no way back once you’re in. Completing campaigns will earn your team experience, stats and even perks so you can take on even more difficult challenges. In a rush? Take on the single missions - or create and share yours with the built-in editor! Plan, Preview, Proceed: Use the innovative timeline system and the full-control 3D camera to design and execute a perfect plan. Campaign or skirmish: Take on brutal rogue-like campaigns with units and resource management, or short but intense stand-alone missions. No-fuss interface and wide-ranging mechanics with deep tactical layers.

Features: - Unique minesweeper-like gameplay. - Infinite replayability with generated puzzles. - 25 sexy images to unlock - with feet! - Colorful backgrounds and girl companions to unlock. - Gallery for all unlocked images. - Can be played with one hand. Gameplay: Each puzzle helps you progress in the game. Solving the puzzle earns you currency which you can use to play more difficult levels. The more expensive the level, the bigger chance in unlocking one of the reward renders! The last difficulty level has a 100% chance for unlock. You need to choose your own strategy how to unlock all images and how to manage your currency. You can also spend your money in the shop, where you can unlock bonus backgrounds and girls. The puzzle is a variant on classic minesweeper, where you need to find all the hidden mines in the board. If you click on the mine, you lose the level without earning any money. If you click on a tile, you uncover a number which tells you how many mines are in the neighbourhood of that tile. The first few clicks are 'safe' preventing you from randomly losing when the board hasn't been uncovered yet. You can right click on an empty tile to mark it as mine and if you are correct, it can help you to uncover the board quicker, as left clicking on an uncovered block will safely uncover all its neighbours if the appropriate number has been marked. For example, left-clicking on a 1 will uncover all neighbours when exactly one of them has been marked.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2361900/header.jpg?t=1684497164,,,cutepengames@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,"Contains frequent scenes with nudity and sexual themes, shows genitalia frequently.",0,0,0,0,Cute Pen Games,Cute Pen Games,Single-player,Casual,,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2361900/ss_f9a138c797fdf6f36da8618b6c4ae2c189b5ae61.1920x1080.jpg?t=1684497164,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2361900/ss_fcabf1bc297baab0ad0b683efb734ac3d53266a1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1684497164,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2361900/ss_f5a4353b9cdc861b90ae8dca8ef9cd8c4397e22a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1684497164,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2361900/ss_de28ceded40116f56e1b29f74de466c61344bdec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1684497164,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2361900/ss_508d6bf4619d41823cd47e165ea6ca87d1242447.1920x1080.jpg?t=1684497164,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2361900/ss_4ca3fcb6db13cdbca8f46582dc1325c700130bff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1684497164",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256946946/movie_max.mp4?t=1684104681
